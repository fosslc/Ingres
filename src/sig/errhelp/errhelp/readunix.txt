This note has two purposes:

	- it explains how the error numbers that you see are constructed
	  in CA-Open INGRES Release 1.1 and beyond

	- it describes a tool named ERRHELP which you can use to see the
	  text for a given error, translate decimal error numbers to the 
	  E_FFnnnn format, and so forth

This information only applies to INGRES errors and not to generic errors.
See the release notes for information about the way generic errors will be
returned to your programs.

HOW ERROR NUMBERS ARE BUILT
---------------------------

An error name has the following format:

	E_FFnnnn
	  | |
          | +-- a hexadecimal number
          +---- a two-letter code, called a "facility code" (different parts
			of INGRES are known as facilities - the optimizer
			facility, the parser facility, etc.)

Each facility code corresponds to an arbitrary code number.  For instance, the
optimizer facility code is OP, and its code number is 4.  A list of these
facility codes and their corresponding code numbers is in the file FACCODE.TXT
in this directory.

An error number is constructed as follows:

	0x00FFnnnn  (the '0x' indicates that this is a HEXADECIMAL number)
            | |
            | +- an error number within the facility
            +--- the code number for the facility code
                        

So if you know your error is E_AB0042, you would 

	1) find the code for AB - it's 40, or 28 in hexadecimal
	2) find the decimal equivalent of 0x00280042 - it's 2621506

To reverse this, going from error number to error name, let's say you had an
error number of 6165395 and wanted know the name of the error.  You would:

	1) translate the number to hex - in this case, 5E1393.  In this 
		directory is a shell script called cvtnum.sh (you can rename
		it to whatever you like).  This bourne shell script will 
		convert numbers from hexidecimal to decimal and visa versa.

		For example:

		To Convert 5E1393 to decimal, type cvtnum.sh -d 5E1393
		which will respond with 6165395.
		
		Likewise, to convert 6165395 to hexidecimal, type
		cvtnum.sh -h 6165395, giving you 5E1393.

	2) The first two digits of the hex value are the code number for
	   the facility code, so you need to find which facility code that
	   is.  In this case, the code number is 5E - 94 in decimal - and
	   the corresponding facility code is RW.

	3) Put the error name together from the facility code and the last
	   four hex digits of the number: E_RW1393.

Most DBMS errors will be mapped to the facility code US, regardless of where
they originated.  US has a code number of 0.  This is done so that important
errors will continue to return the same error number to your programs that they
have done in previous releases - 4700 for deadlock, for instance.

One note which may save you quite a bit of work: the first word of the text
returned by INQUIRE_INGRES (:string_var = ERRORTEXT) is the name of the error.
if you are writing routines to log errors, it may be simpler to extract this
from the error text than to translate the error number during or after logging.


HOW TO USE ERRHELP
------------------

ERRHELP is a tool to simplify the translation and construction of error names
and numbers.  It can translate error names to decimal error numbers, facility 
codes to code numbers, code numbers to facility codes and decimal error 
numbers to error names.

You will need to either create an alias for errhelp or put it in your path.
For example:

To make aliases for errhelp, type 
alias errhelp $II_SYSTEM/ingres/sig/errhelp/errhelp
alias cvtnum  $II_SYSTEM/ingres/sig/errhelp/cvtnum.sh

You can also put $II_SYSTEM/ingres/sig/errhelp in your path;  don't forget
to use the command rehash after changing your path.

The syntax for using errhelp is as follows:

usage:						examples:

errhelp <error-name>                    	errhelp E_RW1001
errhelp -f<facility-code>              		errhelp -fRW
errhelp -n<decimal-facility-code-number> 	errhelp -n97
errhelp -x<hex-facility-code>           	errhelp -x61
errhelp -d<decimal-error-number>        	errhelp -d6164481

Here are examples of the different ways to use errhelp and their output.

1) errhelp <error-name>

This will return the decimal error number for the error name and the text
associated with the error.

	$ errhelp e_RW1001
	  (6164481)
	  RW1001 Bad parameters specified at or near '%0c'
	  Correct usage of REPORT command is:
	         REPORT dbname [[-m..] table | [-r] report | -i..]
 	       [-f..] [-qn] [-ln] [-wn] [-vn] [-t|+t] [-b|+b] [-5] [-h] [-s]
 	       [-cn] [-uuser] [({param=val})]
	  Processing stops.

2) errhelp -f<facility-code>
3) errhelp -n<decimal-facility-code-number> 	errhelp -n97
4) errhelp -x<hex-facility-code>           	errhelp -x61

These all produce the same output: the facility code and code number in
decimal and hex.

	$ errhelp -fRW
	  Facility RW = 94 (x5e)

	$ errhelp -n97
	  Facility 97 (x61) = MF

	$ errhelp -x61
	  Facility 97 (x61) = MF


5) errhelp -d<decimal-error-number>        	errhelp -d6164481

This produces the error name  and associated text for the given error number.

	$ errhelp -d6164481
	 (6164481)
	 RW1001 Bad parameters specified at or near '%0c'
	 Correct usage of REPORT command is:
	         REPORT dbname [[-m..] table | [-r] report | -i..]
 	       [-f..] [-qn] [-ln] [-wn] [-vn] [-t|+t] [-b|+b] [-5] [-h] [-s]
 	       [-cn] [-uuser] [({param=val})]
	 Processing stops.


Your INGRES installation does not have to be up and running to use the
errhelp utility, but you do need to run it in a Release 1.1 installation
environment.  The utility reads the error text out of the external error
files found in the $II_SYSTEM/ingres... tree.  If you are trying to translate
an error number you read in the text of an error telling you that the proper

error message could not be found, and you get a similar error from errhelp, 
it may be that your environment is not set up correctly.  Check your environment
variables, the ingres symbol table (use the ingprenv command), file permissions, 
and resource limits for problems.

Although this utility is not part of the supported INGRES product set, we are
interested in hearing your suggestions and comments.  Please feel free to pass
them on to any representative of Ingres Corporation.
