/*
** CONFIG - C Proprocessor #defines for configuring source for porting 
** 	INGRES.
** 
** You identify the machine to which you are porting by a seven 
** character string, either:
**		xxx_u42 (for Unix 4.2 BSD & lookalikes)
**		xxx_us5 (for Unix System 5 & lookalikes)
** You pick xxx yourself.
**
**	*Caution* This file is used in yypp, not ccpp, and yypp doesn't
**	include bzarch.h.  Which means that you MUST NOT use the
**	clever generic symbols that bzarch.h contains, any_aix and
**	the like.  You can use actual config strings, and the
**	conf_BUILD_ARCH_xx_yy symbols, and anything that readvers returns.
**

**
**              NOTE: GV_VER, GV_STAR_VER, and GV_W4GL_VER are no longer
**                    defined in CONFIG! They are generated from your
**                    VERS file and from the ING_VER, ING_STAR_VER, and
**                    ING_W4GL_VER settings.
** 6.4 leftovers, to disappear when W4GL starts using 6.5 installation
** mechanisms:
** RLS_ symbols control releases and the installation scripts; they all
** have defaults set at the end of this file, if not already set:
**   RLS_W4GL_COMP      true if compression is required Windows4GL releases.
**                      (default false).
**   RLS_TAPE	shell variable assignments for writing tapes, eval'ed in

/*
** History:
**	18-jun-92 (bonobo)
**		Updated GV_VER for su4_u42 6.5 6/22/92 integration, and removed
**		the R_STAR define until such time as 6.5 has star.
**	08-oct-92 (sandyd)
**		Yet another GV_VER update for su4_u42.
**	05-nov-1992 (peterw)
**		Added GV_W4GL_VER and R_HAS_DL to dr6_us5 and dra_us5 for 
**		W4GLII releases. Added entry for dr6_uv1 (an ICL DRS6000 
**		running SVR4 with V1+ security extensions).
**	05-nov-92 (bonobo)
**		Yet another GV_VER update for su4_u42.
**	09-nov-92 (lauraw)
**		Major CONFIG revampment:
** 		GV_VER, GV_STAR_VER, and GV_W4GL_VER defines were removed
**		for all platforms.
**		ING_VER and ING_W4GL_VER were added at the top.
**		ING_STAR_VER was added inside a comment, waiting for a call
**		to action.
**	09-nov-92 (lauraw)
**		Removed pre-6.5 history.
**		Defined ING_STAR_VER.
**	11-nov-92 (lauraw)
**		Fixed ING_W4GL_VER.
**	19-nov-92 (cal)
**		Defined R_INGENABLE for dra_us5 & dr6_us5 ICL platforms. 
**		ingenable allows ICL distributions of our production 
**		releases to merge II_AUTHORIZATION with their method of 
**		one authirization string for each product.
**	02-dec-92 (lauraw)
**		Add R_SM symbol ("source management"). This symbol is the
**		default for all ports, and indicates that the Ingres
**		source management system (a.k.a. Piccolo) is available for
**		the port and that the Piccolo-related build tools should
**		be included in the source. For disconnected ports, R_SM
**		is undefined in the "std_kit" definition.
**	03-dec-92 (mikem)
**	        su4_us5 port.  First stab at su4_us5 release definitions, these
**		will probably change again before actual release goes out.
**	14-dec-92 (lauraw)
**		Removed GV_VER and GV_STAR_VER from mikem's solaris (su4_us5)
**		configuration. (Remember, GV_VER and friends are now
**		generated by mkgv.sh.)
**	16-nov-92 (smc)
**		Added DEC AXP OSF/1 entry "axp_osf".
**	19-jan-93 (dianeh)
**		Reinstated the R_STAR define for Sun.
**	19-jan-93 (sweeney)
**	        First crack at USL Destiny (usl_us5) SVR4.2.
**	12-may-93 (vijay)
**		Add R_SHLIBS and R_ADA for ris_us5.
**	22-jul-93 (dianeh)
**		Modified comments to coding standards and for easier
**		sed-ibility for yapp.  NOTE: If you add comments to
**		this file they must conform to this style (for multi-
**		line comments).
**	22-jul-93 (gillnh2o)
**		Integrated changes making R_INGRES_XLIB a function of
**		whether you've set option=X11R4 or option=X11R5 in
**		your VERS file... Only doing this for the ports we're
**		currently testing (HP/Sun/IBM/DEC). Also bumped 
**		ING_W4GL_VER to 3.0/00.
**	9-aug-93 (robf) definition
**          Add su4_cmw for SunOS CMW 1.0
**	24-aug-93 (dianeh)
**		Removed obsolete RLS_ information -- the shell-scripts that
**		used that information are all gone for 6.5; also removed a
**		few obviously obsolete configuration string blocks (like for
**		Sun 2 & 3) -- probably lots and lots more could go; added
**		the #ifdef'd-on symbol as a comment to each #endif that didn't
**		already have it as a comment; removed the R_CONVERT and R_FSGW
**		symbols -- 5-to-6 conversion gone for 6.5; removed R_DECNET
**		symbol -- Ultrix gone for 6.5; removed R_PCLINK -- gone for
**		6.5. Note that all of this CONFIG stuff should be gone through
**		again, and reconciled with the new release.dat file (replaces
**		Manifest.ccpp) and the whole part-file/buildrel thing.
**	27-sep-93 (jab)
**		Undid Diane's change that removed the RLS_ information, for the
**		following platforms: SunOS, Bull, DRx, RS/6000, and HP8. This is
**		still used for the W4GL 3.0 platforms, and will be until early 1994
**		at the earliest.
**	13-sep-93 (dianeh)
**		Removed more obsolete ports -- rtp_us5, ps2_us5, x370_us5,
**		esa_osf, apl_us5, apu_us5, sqs_u42, sqs_us5, cvx_u42, x3bx_us5,
**		vax_u43, vax_ulx, bul_us5, cls_us5, itg_us5, i39_vme, mat_us5,
**		kih_us5, nix_us5, ix3_us5, arx_us5, arx_us5, con_us5, cn8_us5,
**		rc9_us5, enc_us5, aco_u43, nc5_us5, crx_us5, cry_us5, ss3_us5,
**		nec_us5, dib_us5.  Removed the note regarding adding an "x"
**		to config strings beginning with a number because 1) there
**		currently aren't any, and 2) if there should be some in the
**		future, yapp will have replaced cpp, and yapp doesn't need it.
**	14-oct-93 (tomm)
**		Add R_SHLIBS to hp8 for Shared library support.
**	14-oct-93 (vijay)
**		Add R_SHADOW to hp8, and remove SHADOWX from supported defines.
**		ingvalidpw executable is now shipped if r_shadow is defined.
**	17-nov-93 (tomm)
**		1. Change banner from SUN 4 SOLARIS 2.1 to SPARC SOLARIS.
**		2. Change RS/6000 banner from AIX 3.1 to AIX
**		3. Add R_SHLIBS for su4_us5
**	24-nov-93 (vijay)
**		Add R_TUXEDO to comments.
**	23-Dec-93 (fredv)
**		Include R_FORTRAN for su4_us5 (Sun4 Solaris).
**	19-jan-94 (lauraw)
**		INGRES major release is now 1.0. 
**	19-jan-94 (arc)
**		Add support for su4_cmw (Sun CMW).

**		Solaris needs ADA.  Add it.
**	08-feb-94 (ajc)
**		added hp8_bls entries.
**	08-feb-94 (vijay)
**		Add tuxedo support to HP and AIX.
**	22-feb-94 (lauraw)
**		Change release id to 1.1/00 for the 29-apr-1994 release.
**	11-apr-94 (ajc)
**		updated hp8_bls entry
**	12-apr-94 (arc)
**		Remove VIGRAPH and WVIEW for Trusted Solaris
**		and spurious duplicated entry for su4_cmw.
**	06-jun-94 (lauraw)
**		This codeline is now officially 2.0! Start with 2.0/00
**		for the 06-jun mainline integration build.
**	17-nov-94 (stephenb)
**		Revert the version to 1.1 temporarily since we are handing
**		this off to QA for testing.
