#  Name: Jamrules -- Main rules file for compiling Ingres with JAM
#
#  Description:
# 	Ingres JAM rules
# 	This file should only contain Jam rules and actions. All other generic
# 	definitions should be placed in Jamdefs. 
#
# 	Platform specific definitions should be placed in 
#	Jamdefs.$(PLATFORM_JAMDEFS) for that platform.  $(PLATFORM_JAMDEFS)
#	is defined in the VERS file.
#
#	Build client specific options and definitions can be placed in
#	the ../conf/VERS file.  The platform Jamdefs.$(PLATFORM_JAMDEFS) file
#	is included after VERS, so it can see any jam variables defined
#	in the VERS, and adjust things accordingly.  (For instance, a64_lnx
#	uses VERS to control various Datallegro site-specific options.)
#	Hybrid-capable platforms define separate 32-bit and 64-bit command
#	and option strings in VERS and/or the platform jamdefs, and then
#	in Jamdefs the proper primary and optional hybrid is selected.
#	By the time Jamrules proper is reached, we work with primary
#	xxx and hybrid xxxHB variables.  No assumption should be made
#	about which architecture is primary vs add-on.
#
#	Jamrules is read when jam first encounters a SubDir rule in
#	a Jamfile.  The first rule in every Jamfile is:
#	SubDir ING_SRC blah blah blah
#	The first token, ING_SRC, is used as a variable to head up the
#	directory path involved;  but it's also used for finding the rules
#	file.  jam concatenates "RULES" (giving ING_SRCRULES) and uses that
#	to locate this jamrules file.  bldenv (run externally) defines
#	ING_SRCRULES to be the path to this rules file.  (VMS uses
#	-s on the jam command line to pass ING_SRCRULES in lieu of
#	using a logical.)
#
#  NOTE:
#	When adding new rules, a brief summary of the new rule should also be
#	added to the RULES DESCRIPTIONS section in the comments

#	9-Dec-2004 (schka24)
#	    64-bit iimerge needs to depend on 64-bit iimerge.o, not 32-bit

#	    compiled using REFERENCE_IN_DLL flag except psf/yacc which still
#	    is compiled with IMPORT_DLL_DATA.
#	13-Jan-2005 (drivi01)
#	    SharedLibLink action on windows is missing together keyword,

#	07-feb-2005 (abbjo03)
#	   Add explicit Cc actions for VMS in order to properly handle OPTIM.
#          Change .stamp file in IITIMEZONE to tz.stamp so that Jam won't

#           SIR 114034
#           Add support for reverse hyrid builds. All variables that
#           previously ended in 64 (e.g. VERS64) now end in HB (e.g. VERSHB).
#           In the case of the regular hybrid builds, the old variables are
#           now used to set the new variables.
#           For reverse hybrid builds, variables ending in 32 (e.g VERS32)
#           are set in the platform specific Jamdefs file and are used to
#           set the HB varirables. Main64, Objects64 and Library64 and all
#	    other rules and actions ending in 64 have been renamed in the 
#	    same way. 
#           If VERS64 is set, it is assumed to be a regular hybrid, if VERS32
#           is set then it is assumed to be a reverse hybrid. Both cannot be
#           set at the same time.
#           The string "lp64" has been replaced with a $(SUFHB)
#           which is set based whether VERS64 of VERS32 is set.
#	    Remove generation of $(SUFHB)/rtiforms.fnx as they are never
#	    used and just bloat the saveset.
#	10-Mar-2005 (toumi01)
#	    New CcScToInc rule and action for dataldr sqlcopy.sc program
#	    which pre-processes to sqlcopy.inc. (Thanks, Viktoriya!)
#	10-Mar-2005 (drivi01)
#	    Added a search statement for fe.cat.msg in IIFSMNX rule,
#	    the rule couldn't find fe.cat.msg.

#	14-Mar-2005 (drivi01)
#	    Modified IIFSMNX rule to refer to FECATMSG without a grist
#	    for consistency reasons throughout Jamrules.
# 	14-Mar-2005 (hanje04)
#	    Override MkDir1 action for UNIX to use mkdir -p so rule doesn't 
#	    fail if directory already exists.
#	15-Mar-2005 (hanje04)
#	    Minor tweeks for hybrid builds.
#	17-Mar-2005 (lazro01)
#	   Added new rule IICppNeedLibs which will only be executed
#	   on UnixWare. IICppNeedLibs will do the same thing as
#	   IINEEDLIBS does except it will set LINKLIBS differently for
#	   C++ executables. Also modified IIBINEXE & IIUTILEXE
#	   to set LINKFLAGS differently for C++ files in case of UnixWare.
#	   These changes are required for UnixWare as C compiler and C++
#	   compiler are different.
#	16-Feb-2005 (bonro01)
#	    Fix dependency for IIPWD
#	    Add dependency to mkgv for readvers, genrelid, ccpp

#	    Add missing ;
#	21-Mar-2005 (drivi01)
#	    Added if $(NT) block in IILIBRARY rule to fix the fact that it got
#	    lost somewhere during propagation.  Fixed IISLN rule to set LOCATE 
#	    on shared libraries in a correct location.  Made wincluster depend  
#	    on shared libraries instead of import libraries to avoid rebuilding.
#	21-Mar-2005 (drivi01)
#	    Modified slightly IIICEFILE rule to deal properly with grists for
#           images.
#	23-Mar-2005 (hanje04)
#	   Don't build lp32/iimerge or lp32/iimerge.o for reverse hybrid.
#	   Need to use a "as" from cross-compiler for IA64 Linux so
#	   do so.
#	28-Mar-2005 (drivi01)
#	    Modified IINEEDRES rule to search for target in target's directory
#	    if the directory is hardcoded in the target name, this will get rid 
#	    of tngmsg.res errors.  Modified IIVERSREL to reference readvers.bat
#           on windows instead of readvers.  Added MkDir1 actions for windows
#	    as well as modified IISLN rule to avoid rebuilding.  Added full path
#	    to udt.h in IIUDTOBJECT rule.
#	31-Mar-2005 (srisu02)
#           Made a couple of changes for AIX porting:-
#           - Changed library names` suffix from 64 to HB due to reverse 
#             hybrid changes
#           - Added '-b64' for linking of UDT Shared libraries
#	31-Mar-2005 (drivi01)
#	     Jam was giving two "don't know how to make" messages.  Fixed
#	     dependencies to avoid those messages.
#	1-Apr-2005 (drivi01)
#	    Added grist for linux in IIDFILES rule.
#	1-apr-2005 (abbjo03)
#	   Provide VMS versions of _IntCatStart and _IntCat. Fix VMS actions
#	   for _MNX, _MNXO and IICCPP.
#	01-Apr-2005 (drivi01)
#	    Modified all windows specific link actions to include /PDB flag and
#	    pdb filename when DEBUG is not set to ON as part of efforts to
#	    make pdb files available in non-debug environment.
#     	04-Apr-2005 (lakvi01)
#      	   Ported for Windows AMD64 architecture (a64_win).
#	07-Apr-2005 (drivi01)
#	   Fixed IIFORM rule on windows to search on the correct target for
#	   formindex executable.  Before it couldn't find it in the 3rd level
#	   directories.
#	11-Apr-2005 (drivi01)
#	   My change on on 01-Apr-2005 accidently removed Link action from
#	   Jamrules when DEBUG is set to on.  Put the action back.
#	11-Apr-2005 (hanje04)
#	   General Jam fix up on Linux/UNIX.
#		- setting NOUPDATEHDRS will now greatly reduce the ammount
#		  that gets rebuild.
#		- Eliminate 'independent target' warnings see on ROC files
#		- Everything "should" now jam to completion on the first
#	  	  jam from scratch and nothing should rebuild on the second
#		  iteration.		
#	12-Apr-2005 (sheco02)
#	   Fixed IIVERSREL rule for 64 bit platforms.
#	13-Apr-2005 (lakvi01)
#	   On windows, made dll's have same permissions of exes. So that other
#	   users (e.g. testenv) can execute the binaries that require them. This
#	   problem is seen when cygwin is used.
#	14-Apr-2005 (drivi01)
#	   Modified IISLN rule to keep grist on source files throughout the 
#	   whole rule.
#	17-Apr-2005 (drivi01)
#	   (WINDOWS ONLY)
#	   Modified Archive action to remove object file before adding updated
#	   instead of just replacing it, to avoid problems with bad replacements.
#	19-Apr-2005 (lakvi01)
#	   Corrected permission of dll's in bin on windows, by adding Chmod in
#	   the actions. (SharedLibLink etc)

#     21-Apr-2005 (kodse01)
#        Fixed IIVERSREL rule for reverse hybrid platforms.
#     21-Apr-2004 (loera01) SIR 114358
#          Added IIKRB5OBJECTS rule for compiling Kerberos driver code.
#          Added link information for iilibgcskrb.dll in the IISHLIBRARY
#          rule.
#	25-Apr-2005 (drivi01)
#	    SIR: 114339
#	    Windows crsfiles are merged with generic. IICRSW and SEDCCPP were
#	    modified to acomodate new changes.
#	06-May-2005 (drivi01)
#	    Removed all odbc case statements except *odbc* from IISHLIBRARY
#	    windows specific code, they were added there by accident instead
#	    of VMS specific code.  Added no grist to new Depends statement in 
#	    IIICEFILE.
#	18-May-2005 (lakvi01)
#	    In IISHLIBRARY rule (for NT) iilibutil.dll was not linked with 
#	    bufferoverflowu.lib. Corrected it. This is required on WIN64 only
#	    and nothing happens on int_w32 and other platforms.
#	19-May-2005 (drivi01)
#	   Overwrote actions Cc for Unix and Windows only, and only if 
#	   CUSTOMFLAG variable is set.  This change is to enhance jam
#	   to build .i and .s files on Unix, and .i, .asm, and .cod
#	   files on Windows.
#	17-Jun-2005 (drivi01)
#	   Added IIRFILES rule that will copy all readmes in 
#	   tools/techpub/readme to II_SYSTEM so that windows installer can 
#	   pick it up there.
#	23-Jun-2005 (fanra01)
#	   Bug 114726
#	   Update the default case of the switch in the IIICEFILE rule to 
#	   remove source blank grist replacements.
#	14-Jul-2005 (hanje04)
#	   Remove dependency on yapp and yypp from IICRS files as they are
#	   not use and can cause the creation of zero length .crs files. 
#	29-Jul-2005 (gupsh01)
#	    Added new rule IIGcfXlt to compile common!gcf!file *.xlt files
#	    This file does not compile the doublebyte character sets.
#	01-Aug-2005 (drivi01)
#	   Remove -p flag from mkdir action.
#	08-Aug-2005 (drivi01)
#	   Moved dataldr.exe distination on windows to II_SYSTEM/ingres/bin
#	   instead of II_SYSTEM/ingres/vdba.  Modified copying of play_NewOrder.h
#	   to avoid "don't know how to make" message during build on windows.
#       10-Aug-2005 (hweho01)
#          1) Added rule IIL1OPTIM to handle the level one optimization. 
#          2 )Added rule IIUdtArLib to create UDT archive file. It is needed 
#             for axp_osf platform, and it can be used by other platform 
#             on which UDT shared library can't be loaded correctly at runtime. 
#	17-Aug-2005 (gupsh01, abbjo03)
#	   Corrected IIGcfXlt to build on VMS. Added _YAPPGCFFILE action.
#	07-Sep-2005 (bonro01)
#	    Add IMP application to Ingres installation.
#	16-Sep-2005 (hanje04)
#	    In CCLFM make sure we create the lp${HB} directory before compiling
#	    the for otherwise it has nowhere to go.
#	20-Sep-2005 (drivi01)
#	    Modified dpendency in IIGcfXlt rule on yapp to depend on yapp.exe
#	    on windows, Jamrules on windows is suffix sensitive.
#	    Changed dependency for _USETOOL to be on source instead of target
#	    b/c dependency on the target in this particular scenario doesn't
#	    make sence.
#	20-Sep-2005 (hanje04)
#	   SIR 115239
#	   Add substitution of BUILD_NO to IIRELDAT so that it can be used 
#	   to process rpmconfig.ccpp. This is required to be able to toggle
#	   packaging of Spatial Objects easily
#	21-sep-2005 (abbjo03)
#	   Change the actions _CHARSET on VMS to create the charset directories.
#	21-Sep-2005 (drivi01)
#	   Added new rule for IIReadMeHtml which is designed to parse generic 
#	   readme.html.template and replace the link and the name of the link 
#	   to the platform specific readme with correct strings. Basically 
#	   PLATFORM_STRING will be replaced with $(platform_string) - newly
#	   defined value in platform specific Jamdefs and #extension_string
#	   will be replaced wtih readme_$(config_string).html to form 
#	   for example readme_int_w32.html.
#	27-Sep-2005 (bonro01)
#	   Add grist for IIUTILSH rule to fix build for
#	   front/st/shell_unix/install.sh

#	   Support for Sun High Availability Clusters.
#       17-Oct-2004 (loera01) Bug 115408
#          Added KRB5HDR definition for VMS.
#	20-Oct-2005 (hanje04)
#	   Fix up IIXERCLIB to work on Mac.
#	20-Oct-2005 (drivi01)
#	   Minor adjustments to 2 rules, to get them to build
#	   in main.
#	26-Oct-2005 (hanje04)
#	   Modify IIUdtShLib to work for spatial objects too.
#       22-Nov-2005 (karye01)
#          Modified IICCPP to unset sun (-Usun). 
#	06-Feb-2006 (drivi01)
#	   Added UDTDEMO directory to the include path for spacial objects.
#       08-Feb-2006 (hweho01)
#          Modified IINEEDLIBS, IIUdtShLibs and _COLDATAHB for  
#          AIX platform.      
#	13-Feb-2006 (hanje04)
#	   To allow a build to be cleanly rebuild after it has been setup as
#	   an installation, with blowing away the installation a new set of
#	   rules and actions have been created for pre-compiling the .sh,
#	   .qh & .qsh header files. Eqh and Esqh and their corresponding
#	   actions ensure that the symbol table is renamed before eqc or
#	   esqlc are run. It is then renamed back again afterwards.
#	   So that this is only necissary for the headers, the dependacies
#	   have also been changed so that the charater set files are built
#	   during the hdrs section of the build.
#	03-Mar-2006 (hanje04)
#	   BUG 115796
#	   Add IIPtoolsBinSh for processing patchtools.
#       22-Mar-2006 (hanje04)
#          BUG 115796
#          Remove build.timestamp file from $ING_BUILD (created buildrel)
#          during 'jam clean'.
#	31-Mar-2006 (drivi01)
#	   Adopted IIMKVERS rule on windows. Added clean instructions
#	   for VERS file and gv.rc and gv.res. Modified _USETOOL
#	   dependencies to have ccpp depend on VERS file.
#	   Fixed dependencies in IISLN rule. Defined environment variable
#	   VERS_ALARM, when set the variable will not allow for automatic 
#	   copying of platform specific VERS to VERS (on windows only).
#	   Force IICRSW rule to clean up .sed files in crs directory.
#	   Fix dependecies for visual tools.
#	03-apr-2006 (abbjo03)
#	    Add $(PIPE) to actions _ReadMeHtml to allow it to be used on VMS.
#	20-Apr-2006 (kschendel)
#	   Fix missing $ in $(NT) test in above, broke non-winders build.
#	20-apr-2006 (abbjo03)
#	    Add actions Eqh and Esqh for VMS.
#	25-apr-2006 (drivi01)
#	    Fix "if (NT)" block to be "if $(NT)".  Add a missed '$'.
#	27-Apr-2006 (hanje04)
#	   BUG 115796
#	   Add IIPatchHtml for creating patch notes templates for an arbitrary
#	   build from the generic templates under $PTOOLSROOT
#	 
#	28-Apr-2006 (drivi01)
#	   Replaced Jay's NOUPDATEHDR environment variable introduced for 
#	   Unix platforms with NOREBUILD environment variable and extended
#	   its functionality to windows.  Modified dependencies so that 
#	   executables that depend on shared libraries include shared libraries
#	   instead of depend on them and hence don't rebuild.  The same 
#	   functionality was extended to shared libraries that include
#	   other shared libraries.  Modified copying of shared libraries
#	   from lib to bin via a separate rule now isntead of making
#	   action do all the work, this is a better way of representing this
#	   dependency.  Updated Chmod1 action and CPEXE actions to be
#	   updated to avoid copying of binaries that didn't get rebuilt due
#	   to shared library rebuilding. Overwrote chmod action on windows.
#	   Modified IIBULKCOPY rule on Windows to fix dependecy issues in 
#	   sig.  Take out -use_inc flag from action that builds version.rel.

#	    remove 4 NOUPDATE conditions.
#	    Grist oosymbol.roc when it is being copied to II_SYSTEM\ingres\lib

#	09-Feb-2009 (drivi01)
#	    Update rebase action to get around digitally signed binaries
#	    and the failures that may cause when action executes.
#	    The following changes introduced:
#	    1. We will try to rebase all dlls the way we used to do first
#	    2. If rebase suceeds which it will when the build is being done
#	       for the first time before the binaries are signed, we will
#	       generate a coffbase file with base addresses for each dll.
#	       We will keep re-generating the file every time rebase of all  
#	       dlls succeeds. We will deffinately get a complete coffbase 
#	       before initial buildrel execution (before the image is rolled)
#	       because the image can not be rolled until all binaries are
#	       built.  We will add a padding of 0x10000 to each binary for
#	       growth.
#	    3. If the initial rebase fails (step 1), then use the coffbase
#	       file to rebase just one binary on a base address specified
#	       there.
#	19-Feb-2009 (drivi01)
#	    Update rebase action to do the following:
#	    1.  Use -C flag instead of -c to reduce some of the processing
#		required in the action.
#	    2.  Only run 3rd condition in the action if the shared library
#		is located in $(II_SYSTEM)\ingres\bin
#	    3.  Add functionlity for updating the coffbase file with
#		correct sizes and base addresses after digital signatures were
#		applied and the file can no longer be refreshed using 
#		rebase command.	        
#	23-Feb-2009 (bonro01)
#	    Fix IIRELDAT problem where the target was getting built with zero
#	    length because the rule contained two actions and the first
#	    action was sometimes not getting executed.  This appears to be
#	    a jam bug with dependancies on temporary files.
#	    Fixed the problem by consolidating the action into one _SEDREL
#	    action.
#	12-Mar-2009 (drivi01)
#	    - Make shared libraries depend on binaddr.txt and updcoffbf.exe
#	    to make sure that they're rebased properly after they've been
#	    digitally signed.
#	    - Fix grist on message header files in IIMSGHDR. Dependency
#	    on headers on Windows lists headers without grists, when
#	    message headers attach grists jam can't make the connection
#	    causing a lot of rebuilds.
#	    - Fix Rebase custom action to only run updcoffbf command if the
#	    binary updcoffbf.exe was already built.
#	19-Mar-2009 (bonro01)

#	    Add ULFLIB to libingres.a dependencies, since mergelibs extracts
#	    ultrace.o from it.  (Doesn't matter on svr-arlib builds, but DOES
#	    matter if svr-shlib.)  Fix a couple VERS64 tests that should have
#	    been VERSHB tests, in dbmsexe and iibinexe rules.  Rework
#	    xerces rule so that xerces primary/secondary architecture is
#	    independent of Ingres build primary/secondary.  (e.g. might be
#	    building int_lnx 32 bit only on a normally a64_lnx 64 bit box.)

#	    Take clean out of IIMKVERS because we don't want to clean VERS.
#	    It is intended to contain site or build customizations, which

#           Ensure .EXE files are built when .LOT files change on VMS.
#       20-Aug-2009 (horda03)
#           Rather than hardcode the "special" VMS .EXE files which are
#           not built using a .LOT file, use a rule VMS_NO_LOT.

#	    Fix IIBULKCOPY to create destination directory where the 
#	    files are being copied.
#	06-Aug-2009 (drivi01)
#	    In efforts to port to Visual Studio 2008, cleaned up
#	    some of the rules for Windows.  The following changes
#	    were made:
#		- Added grists to headers and files being copied to avoid
#	          crossreferences.
#		- Added new flags where neccessary such as $(WCHART)
#		- Added additional routines to enhance clean pseudo target
#		  functionality on Windows.
#		- Added rule IIAdminManifest for creating targets that
#		  need elevations on Vista.
#		- Corrected solutions that needed 2005 compiler to build
#		  to use the existing code instead of hacks put in to 
#		  account for support of 2 compilers.
#		- Modified manifest inclusion for Vista to now include
#		  manifests in all binaries including shared libraries.
#		- Improved manifesting process to use generated manifests
#		  and updated C++ projects or Jamfiles where necessary
#		  to include additional information in manifests
#		- Remove requirements for VS2005 and VS2005SDK variables
#		- Enforce requirements for $(MT) variable to be set.
#	06-Aug-2009 (drivi01)
#	    Cleaned up the Jamrules on Windows:
#	    	- Fixed IIBULKCOPY to create destination directory where the 
#	    	  files are being copied.
#		- Added grists to headers and files being copied to avoid
#	          crossreferences.
#		- Added additional routines to enhance clean pseudo target
#		  functionality on Windows.
#	24-Aug-2009 (drivi01)
#	    In efforts to optimize Windows code with Visual Studio 2008
#	    compiler.  Enhanced IINOOPTIM to work on Wondiws.   
#	28-Aug-2009 (kschendel) b121804
#	    If JAM_AUXINFO is defined (typically as a shell variable),
#	    cause gcc to generate -aux-info into <source>.aux.  (Obviously
#	    this is a gcc extension.)  The aux-info data lists all function
#	    declarations and definitions, and can be processed into a
#	    massive cross-check of function typing across the system.

#	25-Jan-2010 (kschendel) b123194
#	    Windows build fixes for 10.0, Cygwin, apache.org Xerces:
#	    - Delete WCHART option which deletes the builtin wchar_t
#	    type definition, was incompatible with apache.org built Xerces.
#	    NOTE: if you start getting link failures against your (old)
#	    Xerces, either recompile it, or get a new one from apache.org.
#	    - IIICEFILE was mkdir'ing junk ice directories in $ING_SRC.
#	    Fix it by attaching the ice path to the target (_t) variable.
#	    - _MNXW action needs to use the DOS style null-device (NUL:),
#	    not the MKS style null-device (C:\nul).
#	    - eliminate duplicated section of copying in INSTALLICE that
#	    wasn't working.
#	19-Feb-2010 (bonro01) b123194
#	    Correct build problem caused by previous change.
#	    Don't eliminate WCHART.  Make /Zc:wchar_t- the default for xerces
#	    2.7 and make the default unset for all newer xerces versions.

#       24-Mar-2010 (hanje04)
#           SIR 123296
#           Add 'grists' to IIRemRCComments as is was getting confused with
#           files of the same name.    
#        4-Feb-2010 (hanal04) Bug 123216
#           Resolve intermittent build failures caused bu HDRGTK being already
#           set without xml2 header location.
#	06-Apr-2010 (hanje04)
#	    SIR 123296
#	    Fix IIRemRCComments after adding grists as targets were always 
#	    being rebuilt. Remove grist an use MkDir instead of MakeLocate
#	    which ensures the target names are always unique.
#	21-Apr-2010 (drivi01) Bug 122651
#	    Switch a REFERENCE_IN_DLL flag to IMPORT_DLL_DATA for ducommon.qsc.
#	    The file was mistakingly getting REFERENCE_IN_DLL flag in the
#	    compiler resulting in extern symbols being imported as 
#	    __declspec(dllimport) on Windows.  This was resulting in
#	    import/export symbol mismatch and link issues. 
#       22-apr-2010 (maspa05) Bug 122651
#           The above problem occurred because of a switch on the full grist
#           filename. Changed this to just the directory - a more general fix.
#	26-Apr-2010 (drivi01) Bug #123633
#	    Add a new rule IISetCMPORTS that is able to set IMPORT_DLL_DATA
#	    or REFERENCE_IN_DLL flags on individual files. The rule should be
#	    called from Jamfiles/MANIFEST files and eliminates the need
#	    for file specific cases in a switch statement in IILIBRARY.
