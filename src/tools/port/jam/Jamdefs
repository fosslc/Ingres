#  Name: Jamdefs -- Generic variable definitions for Jamrules
#
#  Description:
#	Every thing apart from rules and actions are should defined in this 
#	file. Rules and actions should only be defined in Jambase or Jamrules.
#
#	This generic Jamdefs is included near the start of Jamrules.
#	It in turn includes VERS, and then the platform Jamdefs.
#
# History:
#       13-Jul-2004 (hanje04)
#           Created.
#	14-Jul-2004 (hanje04)
#	    Add SCPPLIB
#	14-Jul-2004 (drivi01)
#		Updated variables to work on windows.
#		Modified libraries and library names
#		for windows build.
#	18-Jul-2004 (drivi01)
#		Added libraries and variables to the directories
#		for ice apache and microsoft shared libraries,
#		as well as udt shared library.
#	19-aug-2004 (drivi01)
#		Added PERFMON library for perfwiz successful 
#		compilation.
#	19-Jul-2004 (drivi01)
#		Added data libraries for Unix which will
#		point to corresponding libraries in the directories
#		to ensure generic Jamfiles.  Added OBJSFX to generalize
#		Jamrules that target objects to work for both windows and
#		Unix.

#	    to $(ING_CODE)/front/ice/SAX.
#	25-Aug-2004 (drivi01)
#	    Added an if loop to check for existance of XERCESCROOT,

#	    Changed direction of slashes in a path to ice directories on windows.
#	14-Oct-2004 (drivi01)
#	    Changed $(XERCESCROOT)/src to $(XERCESCROOT)/include to avoid

#	    SIR 114034
#	    Add support for reverse hyrid builds. All variables that 
#	    previously ended in 64 (e.g. VERS64) now end in HB (e.g. VERSHB).
#	    In the case of the regular hybrid builds, the old variables are
#	    now used to set the new variables.
#	    For reverse hybrid builds, variables ending in 32 (e.g VERS32)
#	    are set in the platform specific Jamdefs file and are used to
#	    set the HB varirables.
#	    If VERS64 is set, it is assumed to be a regular hybrid, if VERS32
#	    is set then it is assumed to be a reverse hybrid. Both cannot be
#	    set at the same time.
#	    The string "lp64" has been replaced with a $(SUFHB)
#	    which is set based whether VERS64 of VERS32 is set. 
#	    Add server shared libraries and hybrid eqivalents.

#	    Define more hybrid variables need for Itanium Linux
#	28-Mar-2005 (drivi01)
#	    Modified C++FLAGS to be assigned CCFLAGS without
#	    default.  The default assignment of CCFLAGS to C++FLAGS
#	    broke compilation of a lot of .cpp files on windows.
#	29-mar-2005 (abbjo03)
#	    Redo the definitions of HDRSTRESS and CONFDIR using FDirName so
#	    that they work on VMS.

#	04-Feb-2008 (hanje04)
#	    SIR S119978
#	    Add support for Intel OSX.
#	11-Mar-2008 (smeke01) b120071
#	    Amended Jam use of Cygwin gawk & sed so that output is DOS

#	    All done using a USE_CYGWIN switch so as to not affect other

#	05-Nov-2008 (drivi01)
#	    Add NOCARE for htmlhelp.lib so it could be added to IINEEDLIBS
#	    rule in Jamfile as a dependency.
#	04-Feb-2009 (bonro01)
#	    Define SUFRB to be the opposite of SUFHB so that it can be used

#	    Overwrite HDRPATTERN variable, as the 2.3.5 version of

#	    Windows.  Submit for all platforms to eliminate ambiguity
#	    across different versions of jam.
#	07-may-2009 (stegr01)
#	    Updated for Itanium VMS
#	19-Jun-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122138
#	    Clean up the hybrid mechanism a bit: the BUILD_ARCH jam variable
#	    defined in VERS will specify what hybrids to build, if any,
#	    in a hybrid-capable platform.  The platform jamdefs will define
#	    xxx32 and xxx64 strings, and we'll select the right one here.
#	    Use PLATFORM_JAMDEFS from vers to choose the platform specific
#	    Jamdefs, rather than config_string.  Wrap some ICE stuff in
#	    the (new) BUILD_ICE conditional.  Add missing SHQSFLIBHB.
#	17-Jul-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122138

#	    Add a chm file name for VDBA tools as a definition.

#	19-Nov-2009 (thich01)
#	    Added HDRGEOS for GEOS geospatial headers.
#	25-Jan-2010 (kschendel) b123194
#	    INGICE and XERCVERS used before definition, fix.
#	    Always set XERCVERS with default-assign (windows wasn't) since

#	    as bldenv, or VERS, or platform jamdefs.
#	19-Feb-2010 (bonro01) b123194
#	    Correct build problem caused by previous change.
#	    Don't eliminate WCHART.  Make /Zc:wchar_t- the default for xerces

#       25-May-2010 (horda03)
#           On VMS LIBFELIB.EXE is built using RAATLIB and ABFRTLIB, so include
