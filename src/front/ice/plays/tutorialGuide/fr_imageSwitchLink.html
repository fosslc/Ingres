<h1>
Using the Switch Statement
</h1>
Building the hyperlink in the SQL select statement can
be confusing and make code very difficult to maintain. An
easier approach is to separate the HTML code from the SQL statement,
and this is what the HTML keyword
allows us to do. For each record returned we execute a
SWITCH statement, embedding the image file name (now
independent from the value of the type column) and, in
addition, a
different alternative text for each image.

The first thing we notice is that the select statement is 
simple once again. Second, there is a
large block of HTML code appearing at the end of the
entire statement, following the HTML keyword. This
implements a switch taking the value of the type column as
its variable. There are three recognised play types in this
application: comedy, tragedy and history. There is a
CASE for each. <b>Note: </b> we have not made use of the DEFAULT case in
this example. For each CASE we specify the same target
document, pass in the variable <tt>type</tt> and set
individual picture files and alternative text for them. The
SWITCH statement appears in the HTML statement and this
requires us to
<ul>
<li>Use the REPEAT keyword on the SQL statement
<li>Double up the grave quotes "`"
</ul>
The REPEAT informs Web Deployment Option that it must evaluate a sub-statement
(SWITCH in this case) and because of this we must protect
the grave quotes in the SWITCH statement by doubling them
up.

CASE ``comedy``=
    ``&lt;a href=/ice-bin/oiice.dll/playgroup/plays[play_typeLinkSubSet.html]?type=:type&gt;
    &lt;img src="/ice-bin/oiice.dll/playgroup/plays[comedy.gif]" alt="Laugh at  the Comedy plays"&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;``
</pre></tt><p>
Each CASE of the SWITCH statement is similar. Here we
examine the comedy case. First, we build a hyperlink to the
display document, <tt>play_typeLinkSubSet.html</tt> and pass
in the variable <tt>type</tt> with the value <tt>:type</tt>,
which comes from the column of that name. We then provide an
image for this link and this is no longer constrained to
be the value of the column; neither is the alternative
text.

We have now covered most of the Web Deployment Options macro keywords
and features. We would like to build an

target="page">electronic commerce</a>
application next.
