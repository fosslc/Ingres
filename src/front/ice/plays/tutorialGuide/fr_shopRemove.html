<h1>
Remove Contents of Bag
</h1>
If the user decides not to buy the
products that have been placed in the bag, they
follow the link to this page, where the
transaction is rolled back. The transaction is not
flagged as being completed, because the
user may simply wish to start afresh. If this is
the case, we do not wish to generate a new order
number; we can continue with the one already
issued.
<p>
As a confirmation that the order has been rolled
back, we display the empty table and the total cost
of the order. (This is not
something that one would do in reality; it is
present as an artifact of our example). 
<h3>File: play_shopHome.html</h3>
<p>
<div class="boxCode"><tt>
<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Empty Bag&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Empty Bag&lt;/h1&gt;
<span class="macro">&lt;!-- #ICE ROLLBACK=`t_shopAdd` --&gt;</span>

&lt;p&gt;Your shopping bag now contains:
&lt;!-- #ICE 
    DATABASE=`icetutor`
    SQL=`set lockmode session where readlock = nolock;
	select name, cost
	from play_item, play_order
	where id = product_id and
            (order_nr = :e_orderNumber and user_id = ':ii_userid')`
    TYPE=`TABLE`
--&gt;

&lt;!-- #ICE 
    DATABASE=`icetutor`
    SQL=`set lockmode session where readlock = nolock;
        select sum(cost) as Total
	    from play_item
	    where id = 
		    (select product_id from play_order
		    where order_nr = :e_orderNumber 
		    and user_id = ':ii_userid')`
    TYPE=`TABLE`
--&gt;
&lt;!-- Standard Shop Action --&gt;
&lt;!-- #ICE REPEAT INCLUDE=`plays[play_shopAction_h.html]` --&gt;
&lt;!-- Standard Session Control --&gt;
&lt;!-- #ICE REPEAT INCLUDE=`plays[play_SessionControl_h.html]` --&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre></tt></div><p>
This page demonstrates the use of the rollback
keyword and this appears as the first active
element in the file:
<p><tt><pre>
&lt;!-- #ICE ROLLBACK=`t_shopAdd` --&gt;
</pre></tt><p>
The other features have already been examined. We
note that the session variable e_shopTxn</tt> has
not been updated. This means that should the user
wish to start afresh they will not be issued with
a new order number by the shop home page. 
Since they have just rolled back
their transaction, the order number is effectively
unused and still valid.
