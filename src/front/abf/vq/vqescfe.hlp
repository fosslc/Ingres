The Form-End escape executes just before the frame or pop-up returns to 
its caller.

Example of Form-End escape code:

    To stay in the current frame, rather than returning:

        RESUME;         /* or "RESUME FIELD fieldname" */

    (Note: Only use RESUME statements in Form-End escapes for frames 
    that allow user query qualifications.)
