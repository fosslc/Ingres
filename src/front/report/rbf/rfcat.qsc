/**
** Name:	rfcat.qsc - catalog frame for rbf.
**
** Description:
**	This file defines:
**
**	rfLast		set name of last report edited.
**	rFdetdsply	display report details frame.
**	rFrunrep	cover to call IIRFcrp_Callreport.
**	IIRFcrp_Callreport
**			Gets output options (screen, filname, printer) from
**			user and runs report by calling ReportWriter
**	rFnoop		DUMMY noop for OO routines.
**	rFdestroy	destroy report.
**	IIRFgtn_getname Prompts user for object/file name.
**	IIRFgts_getstyle  
**			Gets report style (tabular, indented, block, labels, 
**			or master/detail) from user.
**
** History:
**	10/15/82 (jn)	written for GBF.
**	10/31/82 (ps)	modified for RBF.
**	5/5/83	 (gac)	now checks for no reports in catalog.
**	7/14/83	 (ncg)	modified to use new table fields,
**			and ate my lunch at Freddy's.
**	2/22/84 (gac)	added mult-statement transactions.
**	1/13/86 (prs)	change FEfehelp call to FEhelp.
**	26-nov-1986 (yamamoto)
**			Modified for double byte characters.
**	27-jul-1987 (rdesmond)
**			Modified for Jupiter.  Uses OO routines.
**	04-jan-1988 (rdesmond)
**			Changed initialize section to handle reports
**			specified on command line correctly.
**	10-feb-1988 (rdesmond)
**			Now sets En_rid to appropriate value before
**			calling rFget() (to avoid unnecessary DB access).
**	18-feb-1988 (rdesmond)
**			Removed range statements.
**	12-jul-88 (sylviap)
**			Changed the QUEL to SQL.
**			Took out the HACKFOR50.
**	22-aug-1988 (danielt)
**			changed rename and destroy activate blocks to re-readin
**			the reports  (a DBA owned report might be uncovered)
**      25-aug-88 (sylviap)
**                      Changed create so it can accept a mixed case table name.
**	1-sep-1988 (danielt)
**			took out MST (OOcatDestroy() takes care
**			of it's own transaction).
**	20-9-1988 (elein)
**			B3376: Check report width before editing. Give error
**			message and disallow it if it is wider that maximum
**			width (-ln or terminal capability).  Also, pass on
**			current value of max width (En_lmax) to report so
**			that report can run reports as wide as rbf can.
**	29-sep-1988 (sylviap)
**			Took out transaction code in rFdestroy.
**	10/4/88 (bobm)	Add "AutoReport" item.
**	10-5-88 (elein)
**		B3626: If rename or destroy fail, don't clear out
**		catalog, just resume.
**	11/1/88 (elein)
**		B3751 -- changed declaration of repflags to correspond with
**		autoreport declaration.  This will make the prompt for the
**		file name a consistent size. The "60" is just leeway--
**		there is nothing magic about it.
**	08-nov-88 (sylviap)
**		Added another paramter, a customized help screen, to the 
**		parameter list calling OOdetail.
**	09-nov-88 (marian)
**		Modified column names for extended catalogs to allow them
**		to work with gateways.
**      29-nov-88 (sylviap)
**              Sets En_rid to -1 when before archiving a report.  Fixes bug
**              when archiving multiple reports, first report archived is
**              repeatedly archived, regardless of the report chosen.
**	20-dec-88 (sylviap)
**		Performance changes - reads in rfiidet.frm.
**	13-jul-89 (sylviap)
**		Added Direct Printing in rFrunrep.
**	27-jul-89 (sylviap)
**		Bug 7209 - For default reports, after rFget, if En_lmax is 
**		smaller than the oldEn_lmax, reset En_lmax back to the old max.
**	10-aug-89 (sylviap)
**		Added Popups for AutoReport and Create menu options.
**	9/22/89 (elein) UG changes ingresug change #90045
**		changed <rbftype.h> & <rbfglob.h> to "rbftype.h" & "rbfglob.h"
**	9/25/89 (martym)
**		(GARNET) Added support for JoinDefs.
**	03-sep-89 (cmr ) fix for bug 8149
**		Change the singleton select to a select loop because
**		there may be more than one row for the FROM clause.
**	11/27/89 (martym) - Added support for RBF report template styles.
**	12/12/89 (elein)
**		*Substantial* changes to Go/AutoReport and Create and
**		routines used by these functions in order to 
**		implement Listpick and Listpick handlers.
**      18-dec-89 (sylviap)
**              Added Batch calls and batch report pop-ups.
**	12/27/89 (elein)
**		Added special case for RBF called from ABF.  Updated
**		error messages (lots) that were numbered wrong
**	1/4/90 (elein) again!
**		Modified RBF called from ABF to use a real form
**		instead of a default form.  Moved calls to do new edit
**		to gtn and gts make error recovery better.
**      09-jan-90 (sylviap)
**		If in batch mode, does not print executing msgs ("Sending report
**		  to file 'report.out'").
**		If non-batch report, does not display declared variables screen.
**      15-jan-90 (sylviap)
**		Added Help files to the batch popups.
**	1/23/90 (martym)
**		Changed to check return code from rFdisplay() to detect when 
**		En_lmax is exceeded for Indented and Master/Detail report 
**		styles.
**      30-jan-90 (sylviap)
**		Fixed bug w/non-batch report so it  does not display declared 
**		variables screen.
**	2/7/90 (martym)
**		Coding standards cleanup.
**      15-feb-90 (sylviap)
**		Initializes val_str in IIRFgdv_GetDeclaredVars. US #573 & #575.
**      22-feb-90 (sylviap)
**		Took out y/n abbreviations in the batch print and file popups.
**	03/01/90 (dkh) - Changed to use IIUIgdata->prompt_func instead of
**			 IIUFprompt() directly.
**      19-mar-90 (sylviap)
**		Only calls IIxflag if not batch report.
**      20-mar-90 (sylviap)
**		Fixed SIprintf.  Calls SIflush right after. Fixes bug on VMS.
**      28-mar-90 (sylviap)
**		If rbf is run w/o the -l flag, RBF can create a wide default
**		report with no error messages.  If w/the -l, RBF will wrap, 
**		displaying error message report is wrapping to stay within 
**		the -l boundaries.  RBF will never allow a label style report 
**		to wrap. (#396, #709)
**      02-apr-90 (sylviap)
**		New -l behavior.  If called w/-l flag, will now out up pop-up
**		(IIRFwid_WideReport) prompting user to either continue or
**		select another style.
**	4/3/90 (martym)
**		Added a parameter to call to IIRFwid_WideReport().
**      03-apr-90 (sylviap)
**		Fixed bug #788 - full prompt for declared variables.
**      11-apr-90 (sylviap)
**		Will pass NULL as the output file (location) to UTexe if not 
**		in batch mode.  Necessary because CL checks if should re-direct
**		output depending upon if the LOCATION is NULL or not.
**	4/11/90 (martym)
**              Fixed JUPBUG #4468. When using '-e' flag, and a wild
**              card is used to retrieve report names, will not allow
**              the user to trash the object names in the RBF catalog.	
**      16-apr-90 (sylviap)
**		Saves En_lmax when creating/editting a report and then resets 
**		it back since it's now possible to create a wide report. 
**      18-apr-90 (sylviap)
**		Will only send -l flag to RW if set on the command line. (#847)
**		Created the Archive pop-up.  Calls IIRFarp_ArchiveReport. (#243)
**	6/18/90 (martym)
**		Changed "rFdetdsply()" to display the name of the data source 
**		for the report correctlly for case(s) when it is not a single 
**		table (such as a JoinDef for now).
**	6/21/90 (martym)
**		Changed to use E_RF0090 & E_RF0091.
**      17-aug-90 (sylviap)
**		Uses global En_lmax_orig rather than old_En_lmax. En_lmax_orig
**		is needed for label style reports in rfframe.c.
**	27-aug-90 (cmr/esd/sylviap) Integration of VM Porting changes
**		For CMS call TOwsnme() to convert 'file ext' to 'file.ext'
**		before writing the report to the file (Preview/Go).
**	28-aug-1990 (Joe)
**	    	Changed references to IIUIgdata to the UIDBDATA structure
**	    	returned from IIUIdbdata().
**	04-sep-90 (sylviap)
**		Changed call to UTexe so the user is passed through the 'user='.
**		Now username will be portable to a platform that is case 
**		sensitive.
**	04-sep-90 (sylviap)
**		Added explanations to the activate menuitems. #32699
**	10-jan-91 (steveh)
**		Fixed bug 35177 in which duplication of a report incorrectly
**		set the right-hand margin of the new report.
**	08-mar-91 (steveh)
**		Fixed bug 34587 in which selecting the `default' printer
**		actually attempted to print to the printer called "default."
**	15-mar-91 (sylviap)
**		Modified IIRFgfn_GetFilename and IIRFgpr_GetPrinter so the
**		"batch" prompt is invisible for those platforms that cannot
**		implement concurrent reports.  RBF checks if
**		(UT_WAIT == UT_NOWAIT).  I changed the forms rffile and rfprint.
**		I made the line "Wait for report" a field rather than trim so it
**		could have the "invisible" attribute on platforms that do not
**		need the "wait for completion" prompt.
**		I also changed the "instuctions" from trim to a field.  At 
**		runtime, RBF can change the instructions to reflect if there is
**		a "wait" prompt or not.
**	03/28/91 (dkh) - Replaced old inquire_frs syntax with new.
**	04/17/91 (steveh) - Fixed bug 36997 in which default report widths
**		were incorrectly detemined.
**      05/20/91 (steveh) - Modified previous fix to bug 36997 in which
**            	default report widths were incorrectly detemined.
**            	Set return type for rfLast(), IIRFarp_ArchiveReport(),
**            	rfabfcr(), IIRFgfn_GetFilename() and IIRFgpr_GetPrinter().
**		This also corrects bugs 37574 and 37671.
**	28-jun-91 (kirke)
**		Added fnamefld initialization to IIRFarp_ArchiveReport().
**      07/02/91 (steveh) Fixed declaration of IIOOidCheck.  Added missing
**		final argument to call to IIOOidCheck. (bug 38996)
**	07/02/91 (steveh) Removed unused variables.
**	08/12/91 (steveh) Fixed bug 38434 where RBF failed to pause for
**		the user to read any REPORT messages if REPORT failed.
**	17-aug-91 (leighb) DeskTop Porting Change:
**		Set value of IituMainform via a function to avoid data
**		references across facilities (for DLL's on IBM/PC).
**	12/31/91 (steveh) rFrunrep now properly returns status.  Lack of
**		the proper status caused the caller to use the garbage
**		value on the stack and caused spurious returns to the Report
**		Catalog.  This fixes bug 39872.
**	04/06/92 (rdrane) 41180
**		When searching for the name of the object upon which a report is
**		based (assuming it's not a single table), set rcosequence to a
**		numeric "1" rather than a string (varchar) "1".  Some gateways
**		see the string representation and do not effect a conversion
**		to numeric, which is the defined format for the column.
**	31-aug-1992 (rdrane)
**		Prelim fixes for 6.5 - change over from IIUGlbo_lowerBEobject()
**		and FErelexists() for FErel_ffetch().
**	7-oct-1992 (rdrane)
**		Use new constants in (s/r)_reset invocations.
**	12/05/92 (dkh) - Added Choose Columns support for rbf.
**	12/14/92 (dkh) - Changed to use set_frs interface instead of special
**			 entry point to change number of rows of a table field.
**	12/18/92 (dkh) - Added check to eliminate unsupported datatypes
**			 from the ChooseColumns popup display.
**	05-jan-93 (sylviap)
**		Added a new menuitem 'Edit' to allow editing/creating of 
**		joindefs from rbf.  Also changed the behavior to display an 
**		error when creating a report.  If no report/table/joindef name 
**		is entered in the 'create popup', then an error is displayed.
**		This behavior is consistent with vifred's.
**		Changed ChooseColumns menuitem only comes up for tables popup.
**	21-jan-1993 (rdrane)
**		Rework the ChooseColumns support to follow 6.5 protocols for
**		owner.tablename and delimited identifiers.
**		Removed external declaratiions which have been moved into
**		included header files.  Redeclared other routines as being
**		static.  This required that the statics preceed the GLOBALDEFs
**		since one of the initializers is a static routine. Replaced
**		instances of '\0' with EOS.
**	10-feb-1993 (rdrane)
**		Have IIRFgtn_getname() check for initial specification of owner
**		and/or tablename -- ChooseColumn was failing if selected
**		immediately after specifiing a table name for the first time
**		after utility invocation. 
**	11-mar-1993 (rdrane)
**		Have rFdetdsply() use the r_g_ident() routine to extract the
**		table name from the rcotext.  This prevents it from being
**		confused by embedded spaces or commas in delimited identifiers.
**	24-mar-1993 (lan)
**		Fixed bug 49656 where RBF did not return an error when
**		REPORT failed due to a machine resource limitation.  Report
**		Operating System level error messages if available.
**	15-Apr-93 (fredb) hp9_mpe
**		Porting changes/fixes to IIRFcrp_Callreport. Bug #50554.
**		Pass a LOCATION containing the filename, "$STDLIST" to UTexe
**		as the err_log parameter to prevent i/o from going into the
**		bit bucket when in interactive mode.
**	7-jun-1993 (rdrane)
**		Call r_g_skip() before calling r_g_ident(0 in rFdetdsply().
**		Nothing was being returned if rcotext had leading white space
**		(bug 52532).
**	7-jul-1993 (rdrane)
**		Fix-up all IIUGerr() invocations to use UG_ERR_ERROR or
**		UG_ERR_FATAL #define instead of hard-coded constant.
**	4-jan-1994 (rdrane)
**		Check dlm_Case capability directly to determine if
**		delimited identifiers are suppported, rather than
**		trusting the StandardCatalogLevel.
**      21-jun-1995 (harpa06)
**              Convert tables names given into it's BE representation before 
**              continuing to process the table so that delimited table name 
**              output is correct.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**      29-Nov-1999 (hanch04)
**          First stage of updating ME calls to use OS memory management.
**          Make sure me.h is included.  Use SIZE_TYPE for lengths.
**	24-Feb-2010 (frima01) Bug 122490
**	    Moved rfLast declaration to rbfglob.h as neccessary
**	    to eliminate gcc 4.3 warnings.

/*{
** Name:	IIRFccChooseColumns - Allow user to select which columns
**				      to include in the default report.
**
** Description:
**	This routine allows the user to edit the list of columns that
**	will be used in the default report.  User may delete, put back
**	and reorder the columns.
**
** Inputs:
**	name	Name of table to list columns for.  Expected to be fully
**		normalized.
**	owner	Owner of table to list columns for.  Expected to be fully
**		normalized.
**
** Outputs:
**	None.
**
**	Returns:
**		None.
**	Exceptions:
**		None.
**
** Side Effects:
**	None.
**
** History:
**	12/09/92 (dkh) - Initial version.
**	21-jan-1993 (rdrane)
**		Rework to follow 6.5 protocols for owner.tablename and
**		delimited identifiers.  This primarily involved adding the
**		owner parameter.  Disambiguate failed memory allocation
**		message text.  Make routine static.
**	13-apr-1993 (rdrane)
**		Ensure that we don't try and delete columns after they've
**		all been deleted (bugs 50683, 50685, and 50761)
**	7-jul-1993 (rdrane)
**		Put out the unsupported datatype message for any
**		disqualified columns whenever we initially set-up the
**		list.

**
**	3-nov-1992 (rdrane)
**		Replace FErelexists() call with FE_fullresolve() to support
**		6.5 owner.tablename constructs.
**	8-dec-1992 (rdrane)
**		If creating a report based upon a JoinDef or a Table and
**		the connection is to a 6.5 database, then enable expanded
**		namespace.
**	05-jan-93 (sylviap)
**		Added a new menuitem 'Edit' to allow editing/creating of 
**		joindefs from rbf.  Also changed the behavior to display an 
**		error when creating a report.  If no report/table/joindef name 
**		is entered in the 'create popup', then an error is displayed.
**		This behavior is consistent with vifred's.
**	21-jan-1993 (rdrane)
**		Ensure that the object name (ob_name) buffer is large enough
**		for an owner.tablename specification!
**	13-apr-1993 (rdrane)
**		Effect full resolution of table name before determining
**		initial/changed specification (b50688).
**	6-oct-1993 (rdrane)
**		If AutoReport is TRUE, then we got here via Preview.  That
**		being the case, ChooseColumns is NOT a valid option.   This
**		addresses b54951.
**	26-jan-1994 (rdrane)
**		Unnormalize userid as required before calling UTexe.
**	15-feb-1994 (mgw) Bug #59800
**		Take out the debugging noise left in from the previous
**		change.
**	21-jun-1995 (harpa06)
**		Convert tables names given into it's BE representation before 
**		continuing to process the table so that delimited table name 
**		output is correct.
**	26-May-2009 (kschendel) b122041
