The form layout frame allows you to move the cursor around the form, 
either to position the location of new components, or to select existing
components of the form for further editing.  The cursor movement commands 
are single character commands, listed in Help for Keys.

To create new components on the form, simply position the cursor to the 
location on the screen where you want the new component created, select 
the "Create" menu command, and follow the submenu appropriate to that type 
of component.

To change aspects of existing components, position the cursor to anywhere
on the component, and select the appropriate menu command.

The menu commands are:

        MENU COMMANDS   SYNOPSIS
        -------------   --------
        Create          Create a new component at the current cursor
                        position.  A submenu will be displayed containing
                        the types of components from which to choose.
                        If the new component will overlap some existing
                        components, VIFRED will move these components
                        out of the way.

        Delete          Delete the selected component, or the blank line 
                        that the cursor is on.

        Edit            Edit the selected component.  A submenu is brought
                        up for fields while a new frame is displayed for
                        table fields.

        Move            Prepare to move the selected component to a new 
                        location on the screen.  A submenu will be brought
                        up containing options for movement, and the component
                        will blink until the move operation is complete.

        Undo            Undo the last command that changed the form in any
                        way.  You can Undo the last undo as well.

        Order           Change the sequencing of fields within the form.

        Save            Save the form in the database.

        FormAttr        Change the default attributes to be associated 
                        with this form.  Form attributes such as whether 
                        the form will cover the entire screen, or just
                        "Pop up" in a boxed window are among the types of
                        attributes that you can set using this option.

        Location        Display the current (screen relative) location
                        of the cursor.

        GroupMove       Move a group of components together as a group.
                        Components are selected by completely enclosing
                        them within a bounding box.  The bounding box
                        is defined by an upper left and a lower right
                        corner.  The cursor location at the time this
                        menuitem was selected serves as one corner of
                        the bounding box.

        Rulers          Allows one to adjust the display of rulers and
                        straight edges to help with aligning components
                        on the same row or column.

        Help            Access the Ingres Help facility.

        End             Return to the previous form.  If you have not
                        saved the form, you will be asked to confirm this
                        decision.

        Quit            Exit from VIFRED.  If you have not saved the form,
                        you will be asked to confirm this decision.
                        (This command is not available when VIFRED is called
                        from ABF or Vision.)
