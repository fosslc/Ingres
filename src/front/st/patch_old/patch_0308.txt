                         Section 1 - General Notes 
                         -------------------------

        a) Please read the complete document before installing this
           patch. Ensure that the section 'Special Notes' is examined and
           an assessment made concerning the affect of notes headed
           'ATTENTION' and 'WARNING' for the specific installation. These
           notes contain special instructions that should be followed if
           your installation uses the associated product or feature.

        b) This patch may be installed over the following release
           versions only :

                II 2.0/0308 (int.w32/00)
                II 2.0/0001 (int.w32/00)
                II 2.0/9808 (int.w32/00)
                II 2.0/9905 (int.w32/00)

           In all cases, once installation is complete the release
           identifier will be II 2.0/0308 (int.w32/00). This change
           will not affect system catalogs or user data.

        c) Although the patch installer saves overwritten files by
           default, it is still recommended that with Ingres off-line,
           an operating system backup is performed prior to the
           installation.


                      Section 2 - Installation Instructions
                      -------------------------------------

	Perform the following procedure to install the patch.

	1. Login as the INGRES super-user using  the "ingres" account.

        2. Stop all INGRES processes;

	   a) If Ingres II was started as a service then stop all
              related Ingres II service(s) under 
              Control Panel \ Services.

           b) If Ingres II was not started as a service use:

                ingstop

	   c) if IVM is running, issue:

	        ivm -stop


	   NOTE:	
	      If you have stopped all other applications and services
	      which link Ingres libraries but receive messages similar
	      to the following when installing the patch, please contact
	      your support representative:
		"File oiadfdata.dll is in use by another application. Close
		application and press RETRY, press IGNORE to go to the next
		file, or press ABORT to stop installation." 
		 

	3. If patch supplied on CD media then load into drive.

	4. If you have downloaded the patch from the CA WEB site or if
           the CD you received contains a ZIP file, then you should 
           first unZIP the ZIP file to a temporary directory on a hard 
           drive.

	5. Enter the following commands at a command prompt:

	   cd <drive containing unzipped version of the patch>
           install

	6. Follow the instructions displayed on the screen to complete
	   the patch installation.

        7. Restart the INGRES installation.

           a) If Ingres II was stopped as a service then restart the
              related Ingres II service(s) under 
              Control Panel \ Services.

           b) If Ingres II was shutdown using ingstop use:

                Ingstart

	During installation the following options are available :-

	1. 'Force execution of patch install even if cdimage 
            verification fails'

	   This option forces the patch to be installed despite the 
           verification of the files to be installed failing. 
           This option should only be used on the advice of CA 
           technical support.

	2. 'Backup files to be replaced in the installation'

           Any files that will be replaced during the installation 
           of this patch will be backed up to a specified directory. 
           The default directory is %II_SYSTEM%\ingres\install\backup.

	   It is recommended that this option be chosen as it allows 
           the patch to be uninstalled should that prove necessary.

	3. 'Install patch'

	   This option installs the patch.


	4. 'View Patch Notes'

	   This option allows you to view the patch notes for this 
           patch release

	5. 'Exit Installation'

	   This option will terminate the patch installation without
	   installing the patch

	
	
                  Section 3 - De-Installation Instructions
	          ----------------------------------------

	Providing the patch was installed with the 'Backup.....' 
        option checked the patch may be uninstalled using the 
        following procedure.

	1. Start the WindowsNT Explorer

	2. Locate the directory used as the backup during patch 
           installation
	   e.g. %II_SYSTEM%\ingres\install\backup

	3. Click and hold on the Ingres directory
	   e.g. %II_SYSTEM%\ingres\install\backup\pre-pNNNN\ingres
	   where NNNN is the patch number

	4. Drag this directory to the %II_SYSTEM% directory and 
           release

	5. Answer 'Yes to all' when prompted.
	 
	This sequence of steps moves the backup files back into 
        the %II_SYSTEM% directory structure and overwrites those files 
        that are already present.
	
	If you have multiple backup directories from multiple patch 
        installations care should be taken when deciding which directory 
        to use. For example, if patch 1 was installed, and then later 
        patch 2 was installed, uninstalling using the patch 1 backup 
        will cause both patch 1 and 2 to be uninstalled.

	If you have any doubts please contact your local CA Technical 
        Support.


                            Section 4 - Special Notes
                            -------------------------


        WARNING:  This patch contains fixes that render existing online
        checkpoints unusable due to the fixes for bugs 97500 and 91957.

                Section 5 - Ingres II Corrections
                ---------------------------------


Specific problem(s) solved in this patch :

	(WINDOWS)
	Some ckpdb and rollforwarddb messages are truncated and the
	subsequent message may not start on a new line.
	(111666) (INGSRV2426)

        (WINDOWS)
        E_CL030F_CK_COMMAND_ERROR is written to the error log when
        rollforwarddb is issued from a non-Ingres user ID Ingres is
        started as a service.
        (101366) (INGDBA284)

        (WINDOWS)
        Fastload fails with "E_DM9411_DMF_INIT Error initializing the DMF
        working environment" when Ingres is started as a service and the
        fastload command is issued under a user that did not start Ingres.
        (112185) (INGDBA279)

        Attempts to start Ingres on Windows results in popup message: "The
        instruction at 0x0076a9fb referenced memory at 0x007c5140. The memory
        could not be read." Subsequent attempts to clean out shared memory
        via the issuance of ipcclean after ensuring all Ingres processes are
        not running fail.
        (112179) (INGINS235)

        (WINDOWS)
        DBA commands (such as lockstat and logstat) issued by a non-ingres
        user while the Ingres service is starting or stopping may cause the
        DBA command to become CPU-bound and will never exit.
        (110053) (INGSRV2742)

	(WINDOWS)
	A database could become inconsistent through a COPY IN of variable
	length data (i.e. varchar) which fails (i.e. due to a bad data file).
	(109085) (INGSRV2333)

        (WINDOWS)
        Ingres does not start on Windows .NET Server nor on Windows 2003.
        (109005) (INGINS222)

        (WINDOWS)
        errlog.log reports E_DMA469_PROCESS_HAS_DIED, when there is
        evidence in the errlog that the process is still active.
        (109615) (INGSRV2114)

	(GENERIC)
	DBMS server crashes with E_DM9C01, E_DM9301. Buffer involved is btree 
	root, btree index or fhdr page. Involves two sessions of which one is 
	readlock nolock and the other is using table level locking. 
	(95771) (INGSRV744)

	(GENERIC)
	Trace point qe90 erroneously reports 0 actual tuples (at) for PSM
	join nodes (displayed in the qe90 output as ISJOIN - Inner Sorted)
	when there are, in fact, greater than 0 actual tuples returned.
	(92567) (INGSRV2009)

	(VMS)
	Invoking a 3GL ADA function that returns a string from a 4GL
	application results in an ACCVIO when the ADA function tries
	to set-up the return area.
	(106895) (INGCBT389)

	(GENERIC)
	Upgradedb from II 2.0 to II 2.5 causes server crash with SEGV in
	memcpy() and errors "Aborting upgrade of this database because
	of error E_SC0206 An internal error prevents further processing of 
	this query." and  E_LQ002E. Verifydb on II 2.0 and II 2.5 also 
	causes same server crash.  
	(106094) (INGSRV1576)

	(GENERIC)
	Building the replicator server fails with errors similar to: 
	Compiling server lookup table . . .
	"rptbldef.c", line 18.21: 1506-196 (S) Initialization between types 
	"int" and "char*" is not allowed.
	(109146) (INGREP0132)
	
	(GENERIC)
	The Transaction Log file %full increases when transactions to
	non-journalled databases are carried out. The transactions are
	not cleared from the transaction log file until an update occurs
	to a journalled database.
	(107356) (INGSRV1728)

	(GENERIC)
	Use of application flags may result in bypassing permission checks for 
	the -u flag.
	(109322) (INGORD1644)

	(UNIX)
	DBMS server hangs in TR routines waiting for the TRcontext_mutex.
	This can only be established by using a debugger.
	Any session which needs to log messages to the DBMS log
	will stall. The knock on effect is LOG-IO waits, LK EVENT waits,
	CS_MUTEX waits etc as resources held by sessions in TR routines
	are requested by other sessions.
	(109222) (INGSRV2020)

	(GENERIC)
	Following fix for Bug 107171, the command
	   select left(right(ascii(date('now')),25),2)
	returns the wrong result.
	(109234) (INGSRV2022)

	(NTclient,HPserver)
	IIACCT ACCOUNTING: On a client(nt)/server(hp) installation, the 
	accounting reports produced by iiacct + convacct + acctcom -h show all 
	the activity belonging to the user "ingres" even when this activity 
	belongs to other users. It works fine when the sessions are local to 
	the server.
	(100310) (INGSRV2326)

	(GENERIC)
	Select using btree index is slower and reads more leaf pages than 
	expected after a large number of keys have been deleted. 
	(108852) (INGSRV1900)
	
	(VMS)
	The Recovery Server may ACCVIO in IICSresume, if the session being
	resumed by the Recovery Server has been removed.
	(109272) (INGSRV2027)

	(GENERIC)	
	Decimal values entered into an OpenROAD entryfield whose datatype is
	float and has a format string of '-------n.nnn' are not displayed
	correctly under some circumstances.
	(108472) (INGCBT434)

	(GENERIC)
	Queries involving views and executed through an embedded 'C' program 
	may cause DBMS server process to die with an exception (SIGSEGV) and 
	report of an E_PS0004_EXCEPTION error.
	(109572) (INGSRV2089)

	(GENERIC)
	On system running many CPUs with many DBMS(or OS threads),
	the following errors may occur E_CL103E, E_CL1003, E_DM901C,
	E_DM926D, E_DM906F, E_DM967A, E_DM9639, E_DM9509. These may
	be repeated several times before the system crashes.
	These errors occurred with the fix for bug 105321 in place.
	(109528) (INGSRV2098)

	(AXP.OSF ONLY)
	Ingres generates unaligned access errors in the terminal
	that starts Ingres, if "parent printing" is enabled (see
	'man uac'). Errors can be seen simply by starting a new
	terminal monitor session e.g. sql iidbdb.
	(103076) (INGSRV1295)

	(GENERIC)
	alterdb -delete_oldest_ckp will delete ALL checkpoint files if the 
	checkpoint being deleted is a directory.
	(109738) (INGSRV1882)

	(VMS)
	Multiplying decimals together where the sum of the scales is 31
	may return the wrong value.
	(95576) (INGSRV733)

	(GENERIC)
	If a user runs two jobs simultaneously against one Ingres
	Star server, and repeated query(s) is being used in the
	application, then Ingres Star server may report error
	E_QE0023_INVALID_QUERY to errlog.log.
	(109618) (INGSTR52)

	(GENERIC)
	The replication thread in the DBMS server may generate an exception 
	(SIGSEGV) and die if a table level deadlock is encountered while 
	opening the needed resources. 
	(109056) (INGREP128)

	(GENERIC, ATTENTION)
	CPU cost estimate to sort a base table is overestimated on 
	machines with fast cpus.
	
	In order to apply this fix, you must run 
	    'iiinitres opf_sort_factor'
	to add the opf_sort_factor dbms configuration parameter.
	
	The opf_sort_factor resource specifies the factor by which 
	query "sort cost" estimates are adjusted.  The speed of the machine 
	may cause sort nodes estimates to be consistently too high or low.
	If necessary this factor may be reduced with caution.
	
	Default is 100.  Any adjustment of this number will have an 
	inversely proportional effect on sort cost estimates.  i.e. setting 
	it to 200 will halve cpu estimates of sort cost nodes.
	(109239) (INGSRV1820)

	(GENERIC)
	Following a user interrupt of a DMFJSP utility
	(e.g. CKPDB, ROLLFORWARDDB) the installation
	may become unresponsive.
	(109776) (INGSRV2118)

	(GENERIC)
	Incorrect results from query, containing nested left and inner
	outer joins, when a column is omitted from the select list but
	is included in the where clause. The QEP shows a Cartesian
	product join.
	(108601) (INGSRV1868)

	(GENERIC)
	Select query with a (Cartesian) inner join combined with a left
	join. The results of the query change depending on the columns
	selected. The QEPs are the same.
	(96265) (INGSRV0796)

	(UNIX)
	Call report fails with error E_RW1001 on UNIX if escaped
	double quotes are used as a string in the parameter list.
	(107117) (INGCBT395)

	(GENERIC)
	select * from t where b='' or b=' ' returns only one row where
	it should return two rows. The problem happens only if column
	b has type text.
	(108731) (INGSRV1881)

	(GENERIC)
	Performing an on-line checkpoint may cause the ckpdb and sessions to
	hang.
	(109857) (INGSRV2132)

	(HP-UX ONLY)
	In $II_SYSTEM/ingres/utility/iisysdep, 'PSCMD' is set to 'ps -auxw'.  
	This causes ingstop to generate error: 'ps: unknown user xw' and
	sometimes ingstop fails to shut down running ingres processes. 
	(105697) (INGSRV2441)

	(GENERIC)
	During an "ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN ... " command, an ACCVIO will
	occur if there is a rule registered against the table but the index for
	the rule does not exist.

	(UNIX)
	An heavily loaded Ingres installation using OS threads may suffer 
	performance degradation due to high contention on one or more 
	of the bm_mpq or bm_fpq mutexes (semaphores).
	
	To address this, a new set of cache tuning parameters is
	provided.
	
	'dmf_pq_count' controls the number of priority queues for a 
	particular page size.  Use of this parameter is only indicated 
	in the rare situation where there exist performance problems 
	due to contention on a bm_mpq or bm_fpq mutex.
	
	It is strongly advised that you use IPM or IIMONITOR to
	confirm contention on the priority queue mutexes before
	adjusting this parameter.
	
	Which page size and priority may need additional priority queues
	can be determined from the mutex name as follows:
	
	Given a mutex name of "bm_[f|m]pq <page_size>.<priority>.<n>",
	where "bm_[f|m]pq" indicates either bm_fpq or bm_mpq and <page_size>
	will be 2048, 4096, etc. and <priority> will be a page priority
	in the range 0 - 7, and <n> will be an instance identifier for
	the mutex (typically 0), the controlling parameter will be the
	(<priority>+1)th element of the priority queue split factor list
	for the dmf_pq_count parameter for the specific <page_size> 
	buffer cache.
	
	Values for this setting take the form of a comma separated list of
	integers in the range 1 - 8.  First list element is the number of
	"page priority 0" queues to allocate, the second the number of
	"page priority 1" queues to allocate, up to the highest page
	priority of 7.  Elements absent from end of list default to 1.
	
	Setting a value higher than 1 for any priority, introduces the
	possibility that certain actions will not effect the absolutely
	oldest page buffer in a given cache, since the oldest buffer in
	one queue may be younger than the oldest buffer in one of the
	other queues for this page size and priority.  This may possibly 
	cause a small decrease in cache hit rate.
	
	This parameter will normally not appear in config.dat, but
	may be added using 'iiinitres dmf_pq_count'.   This will create
	initial default settings of 'dmf_pq_count' for all pages sizes and
	cache definitions.   The default settings maintain the existing
	behavior or allocating one modified, and one free page buffer
	queue for each priority and page size in use. 
	
	Once added, dmf_pq_count settings may be viewed and 
	maintained in CBF.

	the correct time of 1 hour after DST.
	For example 29-Mar-1992 02:00 will be inserted as 29-Mar-1992 01:00, 
	the correct value should be 29-Mar-1992 03:00 as the hour 'jumps' 
	forward to DST at 02:00.

	To stop the system the dbms server has to be killed (kill -9),

	the query when the cpu usage of the query becomes excessive.
	
	The usage is:
		set trace point OP248  max_cpu warn_cpu
	
	where 
	max_cpu is the maximum time (in milli-second) before the 
		 query will exit from the optimizer and, if a 
		 plan has been found, run the query.
	
	warn_cpu is the time (in milli-second) after which the 
		  query plan will be reported, together with 
		  statistical estimates of the time to complete
		  and the cpu used so far.  The query will also
		  be written to the error log and dbms log.
	
	An environment variable will also be checked and if the value 
	is set to a non 0 value, the query will be tripped out 
	immediately by default or when set to a non-zero value.
	
	ingsetenv II_OPF_FORCE_TIMEOUT  [0|1]
	
	    Note: this must be set system wide using ingsetenv.
	  		It should only be set once a query has been identified 
	 		 as running for a long time.
	
	No guidance is provided on what is excessive for a given system.
	In testing I have used the following command:
	
	    set trace point OP248 90000 5000 
	
	which has provided adequate during testing.
	
	Note:  The value of II_OPF_FORCE_TIMEOUT is only checked
	   after 5 * warn_cpu has expired.  At this point
	   the session is suspended for 1 second after each
	   N potential plans have been examined.

	   have exceeded what would be consider an adequate

	Query on a single relation locks the table exclusively when

	a QEP is requested via 'set qep'.
	
	The fix for this bug has been implemented via the new configuration
	parameter opf_one_rel_opt. When set ON this option will cause the
	query optimizer (OPF) to perform enumeration (row, page and cost
	estimation) for single relation queries. Trace point op207 can
	also be used to give the same effect as opf_one_rel_opt. Trace
	point op208 switches off both opf_one_rel_opt and op207. Use
	"iiinitres opf_one_rel_opt" to initialise the parameter to OFF,
	then switch it ON via CBF, or by using "iisetres
	'ii.<node_name>.dbms.<dbms_config_name>.opf_one_rel_opt' ON".
