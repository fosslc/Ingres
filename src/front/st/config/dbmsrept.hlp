 The rep_txq_size resource defines the number of queue entries allocated in
 the replication transaction queue.   This queue holds a notification that
 a replicating transaction has committed, and input queue records need to
 be distributed.  If the queue fills up (or rep_txq_size is set to 0),
 distribution will be done synchronously as part of the user transaction.

 
 Default: 50
