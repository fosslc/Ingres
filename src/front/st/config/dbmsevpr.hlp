The event_priority specifies the priority of the EVENT session.

The priority of a session is used to determine which session will be
scheduled. The scheduler selects the next session to execute from the
list of COMPUTABLE (i.e. sessions which have work to perform). The
COMPUTABLE session with the highest priority will be  scheduled.

Sessions with the same priority are scheduled on a round-robin basis.
