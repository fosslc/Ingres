  The size_io_buf resource controls the size of the buffer used to pass
  data between the DBMS server and the I/O slaves.  If I/O slaves are
  not being used (OS threaded modes, for instance), this resource has
  no effect.

  If the DBMS server(s) are using cache_sharing, the I/O slave can
  transfer directly into the buffer cache, and no intermediate buffer
  is needed.

  The default is 32 Kbytes.
