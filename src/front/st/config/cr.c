**  Name: cr.c -- configuration rule system interpreter functions 
**
**  Description:
**	The functions in this file constitute the intrepeter for the
**	configuration rules system.  They work by traversing the rule
**	trees generated by the parser (crparse.y).
**
**  History:
**	14-dec-92 (tyler)
**		Created.
**	16-feb-93 (tyler)
**		Added support for silent constraint checking and
**		resource calculation.
**	30-mar-93 (vijay)
**		Add no optim. AIX 3.2.2 compiler chokes on this file.
**	24-may-93 (tyler)
**		Removed debugging statements.
**	21-jun-93 (tyler)
**		The output generated by this module can now be sent to
**		an arbitrary file.  Also wwitched to new interface for
**		multiple context PM functions.
**	23-jul-93 (tyler)
**		Replaced embedded strings with message lookups.  Fixed
**		broken forms mode VALID set constraint validation.
**		Improved reporting of prime constraint violation to
**		include two primes nearest in value to the one entered.
**		Improved DMF cache resource processing.  Added integer
**		and boolean validation checks.
**	04-aug-93 (tyler)
**		CRsort() performance improved by omitting all non-derived
**		and unreferenced symbols from those which get sorted using 
**		insertion sort.  Insertion sort is slow (O(N^2)); however
**		it is necessary in this instance since configuration rules
**		may define a partially ordered set which can not be sorted
**		by a conventional "fast" sorting algorithm (which relies
**		on transitivity of comparison operations).  Added externally
**		callable CRdependsOn() and changed PMsymToCRidx() to
**		CRidxFromPMsym().
**      30-aug-93 (huffman)
**              Added <me.h>.
**	19-oct-93 (tyler)
**		Modified CRload() to return CR_NO_RULES_ERR when no rules
**		are loaded.  Also, shortened CR error status names.
**		Call PMhost() instead of GChostname().  Changed "dmf" to
**		"dbms" in dbms cache resources names.  Changed
**		ii.$.dbms.$.$.config.connect to ii.$.dbms.$.$.config.-
**		dmf_connect.  Modified CRderived() to detect symbols
**		referenced in REQUIRES clause. 
**	05-nov-93 (tyler)
**		Fixed BUG in get_derived_from() which prevented random
**		subsets of derived resources from being recomputed.
**		Modified CRvalidate() to return success if no rule
**		is found for a resource to be validated.  Modified
**		compute() to detect external procedure failures.
**	22-nov-93 (tyler)
**		Record all changes in the change log - even for resources
**		which don't have rules.
**	22-feb-94 (tyler)
**		Fixed BUG 54326: make sure CR_INTEGER values are >= 0
**		(not really integers)  Fixed BUG 59433 resulting from
**		improper handling of string comparison operator ("IS"). 
**	28-mar-94 (joplin)
**		Fixed a problem in compare logic.
**	28-apr-94 (vijay)
**		Change abs to fabs.
**	22-jul-94 (stephenb)
**		compute() may return NULL for an undefined resource of 
**		any type, we need to handle this in CRcompute() and return
**	 	NULL.
**      02-feb-95 (sarjo01) Bug 66333
**              Added CRresetcache() for use by restore function
**      10-feb-95 (chech02)
**              Added rs4_us5 for AIX 4.1.
**	23-may-95 (emmag)
**		Microsoft has its own qsort - rename ours to ii_qsort for
**		NT.
**      31-may-95 (johnst))
**              Integrated (mikem) change 414652 to fix bug #64261 that was 
**		applied to backend code only. We need it here too!:
**              bug #64261
**              Changed calls to fabs() to calls to CV_ABS_MACRO()
**              On some if not all UNIX's fabs() is an actual
**              routine call which takes a double as an argument and returns a
**              double.  Calls to this code did not have proper includes to
**              define the return type so the return code was assumed to be int
**              (basically returning random data), in adumoney.c this caused bug
**              #64261, in other files garbage return values from fabs would 
**              cause other problems.
**      01-aug-95 (sarjo01) Bugs 70242, 70251, 70248.
**              NT: exec_proc(): use II_TEMPORARY to build temp file path.
**		Cannot count on a #defined path (eg. /tmp/ ) existing.
**	31-oct-95 (nick)
**		Changed some constants to match redefines in cr.h.
**	07-nov-1995 (canor01)
**		A field with type _EXEC_TEXT that exists in config.cat with
**		an empty value was being parsed as an integer.  It should be
**		parsed as an empty string.
**	27-nov-1995 (canor01)
**		Added new type EXEC_TEXT_STR, which defaults to the
**		result from executing a program, but always parses result
**		as a string.
**	27-feb-1996 (canor01)
**		Added new types DIRECTORY and FILE.  DIRECTORY will 
**		verify path is a valid directory and attempt to create
**		it if the user so requests.  FILE will verify that the
**		value given is valid, either exists or can exist.
**	07-mar-1996 (canor01)
**		Call CRpath_constraint() to get a pointer to the functions
**		to verify validity of pathnames.
**	06-jun-1996 (thaju02)
**		Variable page size support:
**		Added scan_cache_params() for variable page size support.
**		When turning cache sharing ON/OFF (private to shared, and
**		vice versa) or editing cache name, need to scan existing 
**		buffer cache resources for 4k, 8k, 16k, 32k and 64k, to
**		copy, rename or remove parameters.
**		Increased MAX_SYMBOL from 500 to 750.
**		Modified CRsetPMval() to account for special case of 
**		when modifying max_tuple_parameter.
**	27-jun-1996 (canor01)
**		Modified CRsetPMval() logic for max_tuple_parameter special
**		case.  Special case code was not getting hit.
**	27-jun-1996 (canor01)
**		Add special case in CRsetPMval() for async_io and
**		gather_write parameters.
**	02-aug-1996 (mcgem01)
**		Rewrote the binary search used in symbol_index as the
**		previous version neglected to include the last entry in 
**		an even numbered array.
**	10-oct-1996 (canor01)
**		Replace hard-coded 'ii' prefixes with SystemCfgPrefix.
**	31-jan-1997 (thaju02)
**	        bug #80370 - parameters dependent on protected resources
**		are using protected resources' default values for
**		calculations.  Modified CRsetPMval such that if 
**		resource is protected use the protected value for
**		calculations.
**	08-apr-1997 (thaju02)
**		When cache_sharing is toggled, protected resources are not
**		preserved. (e.g. edit and protect dmf_cache_size, toggle
**		cache_sharing and note dmf_cache_size is reset to default
**		value.)  Modified scan_cache_params() to scan protect.dat 
**		for cache resources, and for all cache resources found to 
**		create and delete the resource for the new cache type 
**		(shared/private). Modified CRsetPMval() such that upon 
**		modifying resource value in the config.dat, if the resource
**		is also protected (listed in protect.dat) then modify
**		the resource parameter in protect.dat too.
**	18-apr-1997 (funka01)
**		Updated to display 2k for jasmine.
**      30-may-1997 (muhpa01)
**              Add hp8_us5 to platforms needing to rename qsort
**	07-aug-1997 (funka01)
**		Corrected 2k display for jasmine, it had 4k instead.
**	25-aug-97 (mcgem01)
**		Allocate space for the warning message returned when the
**		max_tuple_length is decreased.        
**	23-sep-1997 (kosma01)
**		Remove no optim for AIX 4.x.
**	09-jul-1998 (kosma01)
**		Add no optim for sgi_us5 IRIX64 6.4. 
**	01-apr-1999 (somsa01)
**		Localized printable strings. Also, removed variables which
**		were not being used anymore.
**      01-apr-1999 (stial01)
**              Removed 'max_tuple_length' from recovery server, therefore
**              it no longer needs to be updated when 'max_tuple_length'
**              is changed for a star/dbms server.
**      08-apr-1999 (stial01)
**              Added missing paren for previous change
**	09-jun-1999 (somsa01)
**		In CRsetPMval(), added a rule for server_class. It is
**		uppercased, and it must not be the same as an existing
**		server class name for another server type.
**	11-Jun-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Do not propagate server's GatherWrite setting to the RCP. 
**	    Each can be set independently.
**	20-jul-1999 (popri01)
**		Unixware (usl_us5) has its own sort.
**	10-aug-1999 (kinte01)
**		Increased MAX_SYMBOL from 750 to 850 to handle all of the
**		rules added with the RMS (98235) & RDB (98243) gateways.
**      15-feb-2000 (musro02)
**            nc4_us5 also has it own sort
**	04-may-2000 (toumi01)
**		Add int_lnx to platforms needing to rename qsort
**	15-aug-2000 (somsa01)
**		Added ibm_lnx to platforms needing to rename qsort.
**	28-Aug-2000 (hanje04)
**		In CRsetPMval, disabled ability to turn on cache_sharing
**		and added error	message for user to explain this. This is 
**		stop user from encountering bug 102438, which causes the 
**		session (or sometimes the server) to hang if a consistency 
**		point is written to disk when using multi-server-shared-cache.
**		THIS SHOULD BE REMOVED WHEN BUG IS FIXED. - DONE
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**      25-feb-1999 (hanch04)
**            Solaris 7 has it own qsort
**	11-Oct-2000 (hanje04)
**		Removed workaround for bug 102438 since it has been fixed by
**		change 446794.
**      22-Jun-2000 (hanal04) Bug 104838 INGCBT 356
**            Ensure the dbms.crs rule for fast_commit is applied
**            to the current DBMS server definition not the
**            default definition.
**	21-dec-2000 (somsa01)
**	    Corrected #ifdef statement.
**	30-Jan-2001 (hanje04)
**	    Added Alpha Linux (axp_lnx) to list of platforms needing rename
**	    of qsort
**	23-feb-2001 (kinte01)
**	    Increased MAX_SYMBOL from 850 to 900 to handle the new
**	    symbol definitions added for GCF security
**	07-jul-2001 (somsa01)
**	    In exec_proc(), on NT, after getting the location of the
**	    temporary file, put it in quotes.
**	08-jan-2001 (devjo01)
**	    Removed conditional rename of qsort based on platform.  Our
**	    implementation is inconsistent with XPG4 standards, and
**	    the stdlib.h on Tru64 UNIX, and rather than add axp_osf as
**	    one more platform on which we change the name, I've simply
**	    renamed this local static function to cr_qsort, fixing
**	    this once and for all.  Also cast param to all MEfree calls
**	    which needed it, and fixed declare of depends_on_node().
**	16-aug-2001 (toumi01)
**	    speculative i64_aix NO_OPTIM change for beta xlc_r - FIXME !!!
**     17-aug-2001 (wansh01)  
**          In CRsetPMval(), Changed to be able to handle the add/delete 
**          operation for cbf bridge configuration create/destroy vnode. 
**      14-Nov-2001 (hanal04) Bug 106315 INGSRV 1589.
**              Prevent SIGFPE in compute() by checking for divide by
**              zero in the ND_MATH_OP case.
**	04-jun-2002 (somsa01)
**	    Corrected prior change by checking the right part of the variable.
**      15-apr-2003 (hanch04)
**          Changed CRsetPMval to take an extra parameter.
**	    CRsetPMval currently will print out to a file or
**	    stdout if that is passed.  CRsetPMval show always be passwd the
**	    config.log file to write to.  It may allow tee the output to 
**	    stdout if TRUE is passed as the new flag.
**	    The wrapper CRF_FPRINT and CRFPRINT should be used to do any
**	    output.
**          This change fixes bug 100206.
**      24-apr-2003 (hanch04)
**	    The wrapper CRF_FPRINT can only take one value to print.  When
**	    Changing the STprintf to use the macro, it need to be printed
**	    to a temp buffer first.
**	    Removed extra comma from the CRFPRINT macro.
**          This change fixes bug 100206.
**	27-may-2003 (drivi01)
**	    In CRsetPMval procedure protect.dat gets updated with a protected
**	    parameter and its new value even though the inserted value might 
**	    violate constraints. Added code to update protect.dat if inserted 
**	    value violates constraints and protect.dat needs to be updated to 
**	    the value in config.dat.
**      20-Jun-2003 (hweho01)
**          Fixed SIGSEGV when cache_sharing was selected in "DBMS Server    
**          Parameters" of cbf. It was caused by the duplicate buffer       
**          names 'temp' in scan_cache_params().  
**	08-aug-2003 (devjo01)
**	    One CRF_FPRINT with extra params was somehow left in place
**	    after previous bug 100206 fixes.  Corrected this.
**      24-sep-2003 (chash01)
**          Bump MAX_SYM t0 1200.
**	15-March-2004 (gorvi01)-- SRS section 3.1.30
**	    In CRValidate(), added cases for negative
**	    and decimal constraints.The negative constraint checks
**	    if the value passed is negative and handles the same. The decimal
**	    constraint checks for floating point values.  
**	15-March-2004 (gorvi01)-- SRS section 3.1.30
**	    In compute(), added check for decimal and negative constraint.
**	    If SIGNED_INT or DECIMAL constraint exists, it calculates the 
**	    correct value as per the constraint.
**	10-Jun-2004 (gorvi01)-- BUG 112430
**	    Modifed CRvalidate() to properly accept integer values. EDITCOUNT
**	    for any server now accepts correct values. Modified output statement
**	    format for CRvalidate().
**	14-jun-2004 (somsa01)
**	    Cleaned up code for Open Source.
**	17-Jun-2004 (schka24)
**	    Avoid a buffer overrun in exec-proc.
**	15-Jul-2004 (gorvi01)
**	    Modified the output statements that are displayed when errors occur in 
**	    CRvalidate() due to invalid input. Removed all exclamation marks and
**	    added display of entered value as appropriate. 
**	02-aug-2004 (somsa01)
**	    Added ability to specify a VALID list for boolean values.
**	24-aug-2004 (thaju02)
**	    Cap derived parameters at MAXI4 for now with the exception of dmf_memory. 
**	    This will be revisited when SIZE_TYPE is addressed. 
**	23-Sep-2004 (schka24)
**	    The special-casing in CRsetPMval for the cache stuff assumed that
**	    the special cache and connect-related symbols would always be
**	    independent parameters.  Rearrange to handle the present situation
**	    where cache_sharing is a derived parameter.
**	15-oct-2004 (thaju02) 
**	    In CRvalidate() & CRcompute(), added constraint for SIZE_TYPE.
**	18-feb-2005 (devjo01)
**	    Replace S_ST0333_private & S_ST0332_shared with hard coded
**	    english strings, as config.dat parameters should not be
**	    localized.
**      24-Feb-2005 (gorvi01)
**          Modified occurences of SSIZE_TYPE with SSIZE_TYPE to allow signed
**          parameters to be handled correctly in cbf.
**      02-Mar-2005 (gorvi01)
**          Modified occurences of SSIZE_TYPE with i8 and MAX_SSIZE_TYPE
**	    with MAXI8.
**      31-Mar-2005 (srisu02)
**          Changed ld to lld in STprintf of max_val as max_val has been
**          changed recently to an i8 
**	11-Aug-2005 (mutma03)
**	    Added code to check the retval from PMmGetElem for NULL in function **	    CRsetPMval to prevent SEG fault.
**	04-Jan-2007 (kibro01) b117214
**	    Reworked automatic changes surrounding cache parameters
**	31-Jan-2007 (kibro01) b117603
**	    Allow '?' in a rule's allowed value, which matches any character
**	    Allow '#' in a rule's allowed value, which matches any number
**	04-Jan-2008 (kiria01) b119694
**	    Correct handling of MAXI8 and MINI8 in CVal8.
**	    Overflow and underflow are now reported so MINI8
**	    and MAXI8 may now be used as I8 values and the status returns now
**	    include CV_OVERFLOW and CV_UNDERFLOW.
**	03-jun-2008 (joea)
**	    In scan_cache_params, call NMloc/LOcopy prior to calling PMmWrite.
**	26-May-2009 (kschendel) b122041
**	    Compiler warning fixes.
**	20-Jul-2009 thaju02 (B122325)
**	    Removed cap on memory-related params.
**	24-Nov-2009 (frima01) Bug 122490
**	    Included 5 header files and moved IIUGhfHtabFind declaration to
**	    ug.h to eliminate gcc 4.3 warnings.
**     16-Feb-2010 (hanje04)
**         SIR 123296
**         Add LSB option, writable files are stored under ADMIN, logs under
**         LOG and read-only under FILES location.
**	02-Apr-2010 (thaju02) Bug 122528
**	    Added check_cache_name() to validate cache_name value.
**	08-Mar-2010 (thaju02)
**	    Modified CRsetPMval(); remove max_tuple_length.

** Name: scan_caches_and_change - Change many caches from/to private/shared

** Description:
**	When cache_sharing change is triggered by the sum of dbms startups
**	changing, it is necessary to go through all the servers to change
**	their cache_sharing parameters - otherwise you end up with the cache
**	having changed but the cache_sharing not having done so.  This is
**	because the cache_sharing parameter of the server where the startup
**	is being changed is regarded as a dependency, but the other servers'
**	cache_sharing parameter is not a dependency.
**
** Inputs:
**	symbol		The item in config.dat which is being amended
**	to_value	The value the item is being amended to (ON or OFF)

** Name: special_rules -- Handle special cache related derivations
**
** Description:
**	When cache name or sharing related parameters are changed, we have to
**	potentially delete old cache parameter definitions and invent new ones
**	that reflect the new sharing / name situation.  This sort of thing can't
**	be expressed in rules, so it's built into the CR-set-value routine.
**
**	There's also a special builtin parameter (dmf_connect) that has to be
**	reset, and all dependent values updated, if we mess with anything cache,
**	startup-count, or connect-limit related.  Since some of the dependent
**	values are cache parameters, we'll check for sharing and name changes
**	first.  (That will generate the proper cache parameter set.)  We'll
**	check for dmf-connect related stuff second.
**
**	Note that this gets called from CRsetPMval, inside the new-value
**	loop after it's decided on all dependencies.   We assume that
**	a dependency chain will affect a cache-name or cache-sharing symbol,
**	or a cache parameter, but not both.  In other words we don't have to
**	worry about some cache parameter being changed out from underneath
**	an already computed dependency list, by the actions of this routine. 
**	Also, the new value should already be written into the PM config.
**
** Inputs:
**	host		Name of config host ([1] element of param names)
**	instance	DBMS config instance (ie the [3] element of the original
**			parameter name)
**	output		FILE * for output file
**	idx		Index of symbol to check for special treatment
**	orig_val	The old value of the parameter if any
**	value		The new value of the parameter
**
**	module locals pm_context, tee_stdout must be set.
**
** Outputs:
**	None
**
** Side Effects:
**	Can delete/insert (cache) parameters, fire dependencies on dmf_connect
**
** History:
**	23-Sep-2004 (schka24)
**	    Separate out of CRsetPMval so that it can be called for
**	    dependent symbols too.
**	06-Feb-2005 (gupsh01)
**	    Cache name is restricted to 10 characters, this causes a segv
**	    for other languages when translated name could be more than
**	    10 characters. Increased the cache name buffer to avoid segv.
**	18-Feb-2005 (devjo01)
**	    Change curr_cache & new_cache to string pointers since "private"
**	    or "shared" do not get localized.  Don't bother allocating memory
**	    for constant string values.  Pass FALSE instead of NULL where
**	    appropriate to quell compiler warnings.
**	04-Jan-2007 (kibro01) b117214
**	    Extensive reworking to make amendments to startup count work
**	    across all servers rather than changing incorrect cache 
**	    parameters, including leaving the cache invalid or wiping out
**	    the cache parameters for the default server altogether.
**	12-Mar-2007 (toumi01)
**	    For extensive rework fix fall through logic that affected situation
**	    where "the existing cache is private - so do nothing special."
**	    This corrects a problem of config.dat being corrupted by iimkcluster.
**	03-May-2007 (kibro01) b118256
