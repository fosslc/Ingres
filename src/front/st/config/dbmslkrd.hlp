  The system_readlock resource specifies the default system setting used
  to determine what locking mode (strength) will be used when data is
  read without update intent.
 
  This default setting is only used if no SET LOCKMODE READLOCK statement
  was issued, or if one has been issued with the READLOCK=SYSTEM parameter.
 
  Possible values are NOLOCK, SHARED, and EXCLUSIVE. The default is SHARED.
