  The system_timeout resource specifies the default system setting used 
  to determine how long, in seconds, a lock request can remain pending.

  This default setting is only used if no SET LOCKMODE TIMEOUT statement 
  was issued, or if one has been issued with the TIMEOUT=SYSTEM parameter.

  The value must be an integer greater than or equal to 0, where 0,
  the default, means to wait indefinitely.
