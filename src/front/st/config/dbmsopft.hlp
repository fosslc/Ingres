  The opf_timeout_factor resource specifies the factor by which query 
  "cost" estimates are adjusted before being compared with the machine's
  "CPU time" for the purpose of determining query optimization timeout.

  On machines with fast CPU and/or disk access/cache this factor may be 
  reduced with caution.

  Default is 10.
