  The opf_joinop_timeout resource specifies the time in millesconds 
  after which the optimizer will stop considering new query plans and 
  use the best plan found to that point. 

  If 0 is specified, this timeout will occur when the optimizer finds
  that the best plan found so far will take less time to execute than
  the amount of time already spent evaluating plans (the Ingres default).
