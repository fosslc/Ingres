  The database_limit resource specifies the maximum number of log-
  database control blocks allowed in the logging system.  Log-database
  control blocks are allocated from lock/log shared memory, so this
  resource affects the size of lock/log shared memory.

  One log-database control block is needed for each distinct database
  concurrently in use in the installation.  One more is needed for non-
  database connections to the logging system.
