Determines whether the server keeps a cache of session stacks for
sessions to use and re-use.  If this option is OFF, stacks are
created by the operating system as needed and destroyed when the
session ends.  If the option is ON, the server manages a cache
of stacks for sessions to use.  Setting this option ON can 
improve session start-up time, but will require more memory for
the server.
