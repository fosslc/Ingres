  The resource rdf_cache_ddbs is the number of distinct distributed
  databases allowed for in the Relation Definition Facility (RDF).

  This resource, together with the rdf_avg_ldbs resource, is used to
  size RDF's Star local database cache.  The cache holds rdf_avg_ldbs
  times rdf_cache_ddbs entries.

  The default is one per connected session.
