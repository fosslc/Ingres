  The direct_io resource controls whether the server will use direct
  I/O instead of normal filesystem I/O.  Direct I/O uses the filesystem,
  unlike raw I/O, but bypasses most of the OS caching and buffering.
  Direct I/O is not available on all platforms, or all filesystems.
  If direct I/O is turned ON but is not supported by the OS, regular
  filesystem I/O will be used instead.

  The default is OFF.
