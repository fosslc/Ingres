  The gc_interval resource gives the length in milliseconds of the
  group-commit interval.

  When a log buffer write is being delayed for group-commit, the group-
  commit thread wakes up periodically to check whether the buffer has
  been written, or should be written.  The gc_interval resource gives
  the sleep time between wake-ups.

  The default is 20 milliseconds.
