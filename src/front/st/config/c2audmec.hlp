 The audit_mechanism is the mechanism used for the auditing destination.

 The INGRES mechanism will write to audit files in the Ingres files
 subdirectory ($II_SYSTEM/ingres/files), using regular filesystem writes.

 The OS mechanism uses OS audit trail features, if they exist.
 The OS mechanism is normally only valid and meaningful for "trusted"
 operating systems with built-in secure auditing features.

 Default: INGRES
