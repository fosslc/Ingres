  The pindex_nbuffers resource controls the number of exchange buffers
  used for parallel index creation.  Exchange buffers are filled by
  the parent thread which is scanning the base table, and read by
  the child threads which are extracting the data needed for the
  secondary indexes.

  The default is 3 buffers.
