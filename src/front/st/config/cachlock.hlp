 The cache_lock resource determines whether or not the server buffer cache
 should be locked into physical memory.  This will prevent buffer cache
 pages from being paged out by the operating system when memory shortages
 occur.  An "ON" setting should be used with caution, as physical memory
 shortages affect the entire system, not just the buffer cache.


 Default: OFF
