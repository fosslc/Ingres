 Indicates whether the Name Server automatically rejects authentication
 certificates without expiration times.

 If expirations_required is set to 'true', the Name Server rejects 
 authorization certificates without expiration times; if 'false', certificates
 are accepted for further validation.
 
 Authorization certificates with expiration times still must not have expired.
