  The dmf_crypt_maxkeys is a non-negative integer representing the
  number of encrypted tables that can be active at one time. A shared
  memory segment to store encryption keys in active use is allocated at
  DBMS server startup. If zero is specified then no encryption shared
  memory segment is allocated. Encrypted tables are unlocked for active
  encryption processing using the MODIFY statement.

  The default value for dmf_crypt_maxkeys is 180.
