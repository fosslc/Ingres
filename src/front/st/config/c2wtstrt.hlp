 The Audit Writer DBMS server thread, is used to help move audit records
 from the shared audit queue to the audit page.   The audit_writer_start
 value sets the number of buffers which are used in the queue before the 
 Audit Writer thread starts operating.  This option is only used when
 ii.*.c2.audit_mechanism is set to INGRES
