  The lgk_memory_lock resource determines whether or not the locking and
  logging memory area should be locked into physical memory.  This will
  prevent locking/logging data pages from being paged out by the operating
  system when memory shortages occur.  An "ON" setting should be used with
  caution, as physical memory shortages affect the entire system, not just
  the locking/logging segment.


  Default: OFF
