  The rep_dq_lockmode resource defines the locking level to use for the
  Replicator distribution queue table.  Valid values are "row", "page",
  or "table".

  Row locking requires that the distribution queue have a page size of
  4K or larger.  If the distribution queue table uses the 2K page size,
  a request for row-locking is silently ignored and page-locking is used
  instead.

  The default is "page".
