  The per_tx_limit specifies the maximum number of locks per transaction
  which can be supported by the locking system.  If a transaction
  requires additional locks, Ingres will attempt to stay under the
  per_tx_limit by escalating row or page locks to table locks.  If no
  more escalation is possible, the transaction will be aborted.

  The default is 750 locks per transaction.
