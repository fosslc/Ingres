** Name: adumtab.txt - Month Name lookup.
**
** Description:
**
** This file is a gperf input file for month names known to date input.
** Actually, any "name" that might be entered as part of a date, but
** NOT as part of a time or interval, has to be listed here.  Mostly,
** that means the month names, but it also includes "today" and "now".
** The d_class member of the ADU_DATENAME struct can be examined to see
** whether one has found a month name, today, or now.
**
** To be more specific, a "month" lookup is done:
** a) if it's the first date component.  This picks up 'today', 'now',
**    and m-d-y forms.  No interval or time starts with a keyword.
** b) if it's after a dash, and not part of a time (ie no colon has been
**    seen.  This picks up traditional d-m-y.  Anomalies like n-n-m
**    will be caught by template matching.
**
** Month name lookup is critical to date input performance, at least
** when an alphabetic month is supplied!  Originally, a binary search
** (of ALL date names) was done, which isn't bad;  but a perfect-hash
** lookup is even better.  It's difficult to hand code a perfect-hash
** lookup, so the "gperf" program was used to generate one.  The gperf
** output is #include'd into adudates.c.
**
** gperf is a GNU utility, and there's no guarantee that it exists on
** all Ingres platforms.  Since month name changes should be very rare (!),
** I have decided that (for now anyway) it's good enough to keep
** BOTH this file and the generated .h file under source control.
** The adumtab.h file is NOT re-generated for each build.
**
** To add or change month name strings:
**
** 1) Open both adumtab.txt and adumtab.h for editing, on some
**    platform that has a working gperf.  gperf 3.0.2 was used initially,
**    any later version should be OK too.
**
** 2) Make the necessary change to adumtab.txt.
**
** 3) Re-run gperf:  gperf -m 50 adumtab.txt >adumtab.h
**    The -m 50 option is not essential but it tells gperf to run more
**    trials.  50 seems plenty to get the smallest output table.
**
** 4) Build, verify that the change is OK, and submit both adumtab.txt
**    and adumtab.h back into source control.
