# ADF Function Instance definition data file
#
# This file is the source used to generate a variety of Function Instance
# (FI) data for Ingres's builtin functions.  The output generated from this
# file is:
#
#	The function instance description table (for adgfitab.roc)
#		(one entry per FI, arranged in an order convenient
#		for type resolution and operator-to-FI translation)
#
#	The function instance lookup table (for adgfilkup.roc)
#		(one entry per FI, arranged by FI number, convenient
#		for runtime execution or code generation)
#
#	A bunch of #defines giving various indexes into the FI description
#	table, and counts of FI's per operator (for adfopfis.h)
#
#	The STCODE generator table for function instances (for adgstgen.roc)
#
# This data file is processed by the awk program fi_defn.awk.  (Use nawk on
# Solaris.)  Refer to fi_defn.awk for instructions on how to run it, and how
# to place the results into the various .roc and .h files.
#
#
# Data file structure:
#
# This file is generally structured thus:
#
# group adi-operator-type
#   operator adi-operator
#	fi description (fi implementing that operator)
#	fi description
#	...
#   operator ...
#   ...
# group
# ....
#
# The groups MUST appear in the order: ADI_COMPARISON, ADI_OPERATOR,
# ADI_AGG_FUNC, ADI_NORM_FUNC, ADI_PRED_FUNC, ADI_COPY_COERCION,
# and finally ADI_COERCION.  (This is not quite the order of the #define
# values for the operator types, oddly enough.)
#
# Within each group, the operator ID's must appear in sorted order by
# operator ID.  This means numeric #define value, NOT alphabetical
# order!  You must refer to adfops.h in common!hdr!hdr to get the proper
# operator ID ordering.
#
# All FI's for a given operator must appear together.  Ordering is generally
# not specified.  If some particular order is needed for proper type
# resolution, it should be documented.
#
# ** It is up to you to keep the entries in their proper order! **
#
# As should be obvious by this point, a line beginning with # is a comment
# line, in standard awk-y style.  Blank lines are ignored and can be used
# as desired for clarity.
#
# A FI description entry is a multi line entry which has the
# components:
#	fi		function instance number
#	description	description of fi
#	complement	complement FI id
#	flags		optional FI flags
#	lenspec		FI result length specification
#	workspace	optional workspace size
#	null_preinst	Pre-instruction for nullable data handling
#	result		result data type
#	operands	data type of operands if any
#	routine		FI handler routine
#	stcode		STCODE generation info
#
# After the "fi" entry, the lines can be in any order.
# The fi, description, lenspec, null_preinst, result, and stcode
# entries are required.
# The complement, flags, workspace, operands, and routine entries are
# not required.
#
# fi fi-number
#	Must be the first entry of a FI definition, and gives the
#	ADFI_xxx function instance ID number.
#
# description any-text
#	A short description of the FI, just for documentation.
#	The text is also output in a C comment before the FI definition in
#	adgfitab.roc, to make it easier to find things there.
#
# complement fi-number
#	For comparison FI's, the FI ID of the complement function (i.e. the
#	function to use if the FI operands are reversed).
#	ADI_NOFI if omitted.
#
# flags fi-flags
#	Flags for the adi_fiflags member of the FI description.  This
#	can be any constant expression (e.g. flag | flag).
#	ADI_F0_NOFIFLAGS if omitted.
#
# lenspec lenspec-op fixed-size fixed-prec-scale
#	The lenspec definition for the result of the FI.  At least the
#	lenspec-op (the adi_lncompute member of an ADI_LENSPEC) is required.
#	fixed-size, or both fixed-size and fixed-prec-scale, may be
#	specified for fixed size result lenspecs.
#	Warning! Don't put any spaces in "fixed-size" or "fixed-prec-scale",
#	or you'll confuse the AWK program generator.
#	Anything omitted is set to zero.
#
# workspace ws-length
#	The length (bytes) of a workspace if the FI needs any.
#	Zero if omitted.
#
# null_preinst ade_null_op
#	The pre-instruction to use if operands or result are nullable.
#	(ADE_1CXI_SET_SKIP and its friends.)
#	Specify ADE_0CXI_IGNORE if no null pre-instruction is needed.
#
# result datatype
#	The DB_xxx_TYPE data type of the result.
#
# operands datatype ...
#	The DB_xxx_TYPE data types of the operands.  The number of data
#	types listed is counted and used as the operand count for the FI.
#	If omitted, the FI is a zero operand function.
#
# routine adu [agg-begin agg-end]
#	If the FI has an ADF routine to execute it, that routine is
#	listed here.  (It's usually an adu or adc routine.)  For aggregate
#	functions, two additional routines are needed, for begin and end.
#	If omitted, NULL is stored in the FI lookup table.
#
#	Note that CX execution may choose to execute a FI inline, rather
#	than using the listed routine.  If however no routine is listed,
#	CX execution *must* implement the FI inline in some manner.
#
# stcode stcode-case handler [handler ...]
#	The STCODE code-generation case is listed, followed by one or more
#	handler routine addresses for STCODE execution of the FI.
#	If many handlers must be listed, the entry may be continued with
#	a -- at the end of the line, thus:
#	  stcode STC_GEN_DATA3 _ade_i1_i1_add_i1 _ade_i1_i1_add_i2 --
#			_ade_i1_i1_add_i4 _ade_i1_i1_add_i8 ... etc
#	(I chose -- as being easier to see than the traditional \, and
#	marginally easier to handle in awk.)
#
#	For FI's that resolve to many different handlers depending on data
#	item length, the convention is that the leftmost lengths vary
#	fastest (just as the routines are listed in adehandler.c).
#
# History:
#
#	22-Mar-2005 (schka24)
#	    Start with the existing adgfitab.roc and adgfilkup.roc to
#	    produce this data file -- old way of maintaining the .roc's
#	    was excessively tedious and error prone, and I will need to
#	    include STCODE generation data as well.
#	28-Mar-2005 (schka24)
#	    I buggered up the workspace definitions, broke long varchar.
#	08-Jun-2005 (gupsh01)
#	    Removed ADFI_998_NCHAR_LIKE_NVCHAR and 
#	    ADFI_999_NCHAR_NOTLIKE_NVCHAR. This is breaking up 
#	    nchar like varchar case, and these are correctly handled
#	    by other function instances.
#	13-june-05 (inkdo01)
#	    Increase result length of ii_dv_desc() to 64 for collations.
#	14-june-05 (gupsh01)
#	    Removed function instances ADFI_1002_CONCAT.. to ADFI_1008_CONCAT..
#	17-aug-05 (inkdo01)
#	    Change sum(int) to 8 byte result to make more room.
#	13-apr-06 (dougi)
#	    Added isdst() function to identify dates that are in daylight
#	    savings time.
#	7-june-06 (dougi)
#	    Added F.I.'s for coercing to/from int/flt and char/varchar/nchar/
#	    nvchar.
#	3-july-06 (dougi)
#	    Changed "to int/flt" coercions from above to use ADI_CTO48 lenspec.
#	04-aug-06 (stial01)
#	    Added entries for substring, position for blobs
#	30-aug-06 (gupsh01)
#	    Added entries for ANSI datetime functions. 
#	05-sep-06 (gupsh01)
#	    Added entries for interval_ytom, interval_dtos and ingresdate.
#	13-sep-2006 (dougi)
#	    Removed FI's for int/string coercion in favour of solution
#	    implemented in pstrslv.c.
#	13-sep-2006 (gupsh01)
#	    Fixed date/time function instances. current_date,current-time etc 
#	    now return the actual date/time types instead of string types.
#	18-oct-2006 (dougi)
#	    Added year(), quarter(), month(), week(), week_iso(), day(),
#	    hour(), minute(), second(), microsecond() functions for date part
#	    extraction.
#	23-oct-2006 (stial01)
#	    Back out Ingres2007 change to iistructure()
#	16-oct-2006 (stial01)
#           Added locator functions.
#	25-oct-2006 (gupsh01)
#           Modified reslen for date2date coercion.
#	14-nov-2006 (dougi)
#	    Remove func vars for Unicode compares - they're done inline in the
#	    big switch. And increase result length of _version().
#	10-dec-2006 (gupsh01)
#           Added date arithmetic function instances.
#	08-dec-2006 (stial01)
#	    Added/updated POSition funcions
#	19-dec-2006 (dougi)
#	    Added coercion from LTXT to LTXT and EQ pred of LTXT to LTXT
#	    to permit unions of NULLs
#       19-dec-2006 (stial01)
#           Added ADFI_1273_NVCHAR_ALL_I for nvarchar(all,i)
#	02-jan-2007 (stial01)
#	    Fixed integration of NVCHAR_ALL_I.
#	03-jan-2007 (gupsh01)
#           Added datetime + interval addition function instances.
#	22-jan-2007 (gupsh01)
#	    Added coercion between nvarchar to long varchar and varchar
#	    to long nvarchar.
#	25-jan-2007 (stial01)
#	    Fixed ascii,char,text,varchar,varbyte fi's
#	1-feb-2007 (dougi)
#	    Make date_part() result 4-byte integer to accomodate microsecond,
#	    nanosecond options.
#	12-feb-2007 (stial01)
#	    Undo some of 25-jan-2007 fi cleanup, requires upgradedb -trees
#	8-mar-2007 (dougi)
#	    Add round() function for decimal type (for TPC DS).
#	09-mar-2007 (gupsh01)
#	    Added lowercase and uppercase for long nvarchar.
#	13-apr-2007 (dougi)
#	    Add definitions for trunc[ate](), ceil[ing](), floor(),
#	    chr(), ltrim(), rtrim().
#	16-apr-2007 (dougi)
#	    And lpad(), rpad() and replace().
#	2-may-2007 (dougi)
#	    And tan(), acos(), asin(), pi() and sign().
#	24-May-2007 (smeke01) b118276
#	    Made all integer arithmetic coerce to i8. This clears b118276
#	    (inconsistent overflow behaviour) as well as simplifying things.
#	4-june-2007 (dougi)
#	    Make bit_length() a DB_ALL_TYPE function.
#	13-jul-2007 (gupsh01)
#	    Modified result lengths for lowercase and uppercase for 
#	    long nvarchar.
#	23-Jul-2007 (smeke01) b118798.
#	    Amended fix for bug b118276 so that integer arithmetic will be
#	    i8 for clients that can cope with i8s, and i4 for those that can't.
#	09-aug-2007 (gupsh01)
#	    Fixed typo ADI_01UNIDBL to ADI_O1UNIDBL.
#	10-Aug-2007 (kiria01) b118254
#	    Marked existing CHAREXTRACT functions as legacy FIs to support existing CX
#	    data. Added new versions returning (n)varchar(4)
#	    Extant compiled data can still use old definitions but these should now
#	    not be resolvable. This allows functions to be removed or altered without
#	    breaking existing CX data.
#	20-Aug-2007 (toumi01 for kiria01) b118981
#	    Added entries for c + char, char + c, c + varchar to maintain
#	    historical behavior of these operations.
#       22-Aug-2007 (kiria01) b118999
#           Change the legacy marked charextract into byteextract and introduce
#           new function to provide the old behavior in for the system views such
#           as iitable.
#	27-Aug-2007 (gupsh01) b
#	    Revert C LIKE VARCHAR AND CHAR LIKE VARCHAR as it causes ambiguous
#	    FI case.
#	17-Oct-2007 (kiria01) b117790
#	    Relegate money from implicit coercions.
#	    Add missing N(V)CHR to DECIMAL, FLOAT/INT <-> string type coercions
#	    to complete the bias of implicit coercions to DECIMAL and away from
#	    money.
#	    These additions have been made with the ADI_F8192_QUEL_CLOAKED flag
#	    set to avoid destablising Quel coercions. This flag and the corresponding
#	    ADI_F4096_SQL_CLOAKED replace the more limited but similar legacy flag.
#       29-Oct-2007 (hanal04) Bug 119368
#           Rework i8 handling for client's without i8 support. PSF will
#           now ensure the RESDOMs are capped. This allows ADF to to use
#           i8s on all but the RESDOMs.
#	03-Nov-2007 (kiria01) b119410
#	    Add in the NUMERIC compare operators.
#	26-Dec-2007 (kiria01) SIR119658
#	    Added 'is integer/decimal/float' operators.
#	28-Dec-2007 (lunbr01) b119125
#	    Change default return type for ii_ipaddr() from BYTE (len=16)
#	    to varbyte (len = 4 for IPv4, 16 for IPv6) as part of adding
#	    IPv6 support to ii_ipaddr().  Keep old defn as CLOAKED for
#	    backward compat.
#	01-Feb-2008 (kiria01) b119859
#	    Add missing NCHAR(all,i) function
#	07-Mar-2008 (kiria01) b120043
#	    Added missing date operators '*', '/' and unary '+' & '-'
#	11-Apr-2008 (gupsh01) b120210
#	    Added coercion between varbyte and tablekey and logicalkey.
#	12-Apr-2008 (kiria0) b119410
#	    Deprecate the original NUMERIC compare operators and instead
#		use a normalising coercion (ADFI__NUMERIC_NORM) with
#		BYTE-BYTE compares.
#	18-Apr-2008 (kiria01) b120284
#	    Corrected output data types for local_time/local_timestamp
#	10-Jul-2008 (kiria01) b119410
#	    Restore the original NUMERIC compare operators as they will
#	    be needed by pure ADF clients.
#	15-Jul-2008 (kiria01) SIR120473
#	    Added LVCH & LNVCHR varieties of LIKE.
#
#       28-Jul-2008 (horda03) Bug 120634
#           CHAR + C didn't trim the CHAR before concatenating the two
#           strings.
#       10-sep-2008 (gupsh01,stial01)
#           Added FI's for ADI_UNORM_OP
#	02-oct-2008 (toumi01) (bug 120966)
#	    Change UNHEX FI's to return type DB_VBYTE_TYPE not DB_VCH_TYPE.
#       22-sep-2008 (stial01)
#           Added FI's for tab_key/log_key to byte 
#	26-Oct-2008 (kiria01) SIR121012
#	    Corrected VARFI setup for constant folding:
#	    Of the previously marked VARFI functions, some are clear, some
#	    remain and others get marked CHKVARFI. This latter flag allows
#	    for a function to indicate whether it did something to break
#	    the constant nature. For example, str->date is usually constant
#	    but breaks if an operation needs to refer to the real time. In
#	    this case we are now told that the performed operation was not
#	    a constant one and we can treat it accordingly.
#	    All the str->float/decimal/money operations were marked VARFI
#	    because they had decimal point or currency implications. As
#	    coercion to binary form leaves the value in a decimal point
#	    neutral form we treat them as constant. This is not the case
#	    for the conversions to string forms - these have to remain but
#	    this is no great loss as it is often only needed at output
#	    time.
#	    Many of the Unicode<->non-Unicode conversions were marked
#	    VARFI due to the possibilty of unmappable characters. This
#	    only affects conversion out of Unicode so these get CHKVARFI
#	    and the other treated as constant.
#	27-Oct-2008 (kiria01) SIR120473
#	    Added patcomp functions
#	04-Dec-2008 (kiria01) b121297
#	    Added ADFI_1395_DATE_SUB_VCH for relaxed dates and removed
#	    the erroneous flag setting from ADFI_1270_ANSIDATE_SUB_ANSIDATE
#	12-Dec-2008 (kiria01) b121297
#	    Added ADFI_1396_DATE_ADD_VCH for relaxed dates
#       28-jan-2009 (stial01)
#           Use defines for iitypename(), iistructure() result
#	12-Feb-2009 (kiria01) SIR 121012
#	    Set the VARFI bit on _cache_size(), resolve_table(),
#	    iitotal_allocated_pages(), iitotal_overflow_pages(),
#	    session_priv() and iitblstat(). This to allow them to be
#	    unmolested through constant folding which would finalise
#	    them during view creation as opposed to execution.
#	02-Mar-2008 (kiria01) b121420
#	    Increased the workspace amounts for long operations to include
#	    enough for two segments plus the ADP_LO_WKSP itself.
#	05-Mar-2009 (kiria01) b121520
#	    Make BYTEEXTRACT return BYTE(1) instead of CHAR(1)
#	12-Mar-2009 (kiria01) SIR121788
#	    Added ADFI_1397_LNVCHR_TO_LVCH, ADFI_1398_LVCH_TO_LNVCHR,
#	    ADFI_1399_LVCH_LNVCHR, ADFI_1400_LNVCHR_LVCH,
#	    ADFI_1401_LNVCHR_LBYTE, ADFI_1402_LNVCHR_LNVCHR,
#	    ADFI_1403_LNVCHR_CHAR, ADFI_1404_LNVCHR_C,
#	    ADFI_1405_LNVCHR_TEXT, ADFI_1406_LNVCHR_VARCHAR and
#	    ADFI_1407_LNVCHR_LTXT
#	17-Mar-2009 (kiria01) SIR121788
#	    Added ADFI_1408_LCLOC_TO_LBYTE, ADFI_1409_LCLOC_TO_LNVCHR,
#	    ADFI_1410_LBLOC_TO_LVCH and ADFI_1411_LNLOC_TO_LVCH
#	17-Mar-2009 (toumi01) b121809
#	    Change ADFI_831_UNHEX_C to ADFI_831_UNHEX_ALL to avoid
#	    unnecessary coercions. Correct ADFI_371_HEX_C to
#	    ADFI_371_HEX_ALL to make it match its description and
#	    the fact that it takes DB_ALL_TYPE operands.
#	19-Mar-2009 (kiria01) SIR121788
#	    Added the missing long byte coercions and switched the
#	    routine from adu_lvch_move to adu_long_coerce where a
#	    dmf move was not appropriate. Corrected the adu_lvch_move
#	    operations that erronously used ADI_RESLEN, ADI_O1 etc.
#	15-Apr-2009 (kiria01) SIR121788
#	    Move the LBYTE<>LVCH to use adu_long_coerce as conversion
#	    needed after all.
#   22-Apr-2009 (Marty Bowes) SIR 121969
#       Add generate_digit() and validate_digit() for the generation
#       and validation of checksum values.
#	25-Apr-2009 (kiria01) SIR121788
#	    Revert previous change as LBYTE<>LVCH can be done more
#	    efficiently without the conversion which is not needed
#	    afterall. That includes the locator forms as input too.
#	9-sep-2009 (stephenb)
#		Add last_identity function.
#	23-Jun-2009 (kibro01) b122225
#	    Use ADE_2CXI_SKIP for nullable stddev and var functions.
#       01-Aug-2009 (martin bowes) SIR122320
#           Added soundex_dm (Daitch-Mokotoff soundex)
#	31-Aug-2009 (kschendel) b122510
#	    Add FI's for string(ucode,n) type conversions.  The (all,n)
#	    FI's have skip-unicode set, and call the wrong coercion wrapper.
#       03-Sep-2009 (coomi01) b122473
#           Add ADFI_1417_BYTE_ALL_I to prevent auto conversion to
#           char string.
#       21-Sep-2009 (coomi01) b122607
#           Correct result lenspec for substring(c,int,int)
#       22-Sep-2009 (coomi01) b122607
#           Correct typo, and change return type for substring(c,int,int)
#	23-Sep-2009 (kiria01) b122578
#	    Add ADI_F512_RES2NDARG to ADI_IFTRUE_OP to allow updated
#	    fdesc to be propagated during resolution.
#
#       24-Sep-2009 (horda03) b122585
#           For IFNULL(date,date) Added ADI_F512_RES1STARG.
#           The existance of both flags is used in DT family processing to
#           determine the appropriate result type.
#           Also, when converting a DATE to a string the space needed for the
#           string is dependant on the DATE type being converted.
#           Rearranged the order of the IFNULL functions to conform to the 
#           IFNULL result data type order in the SQL Ref. Guide.
#       29-sep-2009 (joea)
#           Add BOO_ISFALSE, BOO_NOFALSE, BOO_ISTRUE, BOO_NOTRUE, BOO_TO_BOO,
#           LTXT_TO_BOO, BOO_EQ_BOO, BOO_NE_BOO, BOO_LE_BOO, BOO_GT_BOO,
#           BOO_GE_BOO, BOO_LT_BOO, BOO_ISUNKN, BOO_NOUNKN,
#           BOO_COPYTO_{C|TEXT|CHAR|VCH}, {C|TEXT|CHAR|VCH}_COPYTO_BOO.
#       21-oct-2009 (joea)
#           Replace lenspec's of most DB_BOO_TYPE results with DB_BOO_LEN.
#       28-oct-2009 (joea)
#           Add BOO_CHAR, BOO_VCH, BOO_C, BOO_TEXT, CHAR_TO_BOO, C_TO_BOO,
#           TEXT_TO_BOO, I_TO_BOO and BOO_I.
#	12-Nov-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122882
#	    Add iicmptversion.
#	14-Nov-2009 (kiria01) SIR 122894
#	    Added GREATEST,LEAST,GREATER and LESSER generic polyadic functions.
#	    These pairs differ only in their handling of NULLs: GREATEST and LEAST
#	    are value oriented and will ignore NULLs. GREATER and LESSER propagate
#	    NULLs.
#       07-dec-2009 (drewsturgiss)
#			Added NVL and NVL2 function definitions
#       14-dec-2009 (drewsturgiss)
#			Removed NVL function definitions
#			Replaced multiple NVL2 fi's with a single ALL datatype
#       07-jan-2010 (joea)
#           Change lenspec's of coercions to DB_BOO_TYPE to ADI_FIXED.
#       12-jan-2010 (joea)
#           Change null_preinst for BOO_ISFALSE, BOO_NOFALSE, BOO_ISTRUE and
#           BOO_NOTRUE to ADE_0CXI_IGNORE.
#	19-Feb-2010 (kiria01) b123308
#	    ADI_DECBLEND functionality is now in ADI_LONGER.
#       05-mar-2010 (joea)
#           Add BOO_BOO.
#	10-Mar-2010 (toumi01) SIR 122403
#	    Added ADI_AES_DECRYPT_OP and ADI_AES_ENCRYPT_OP.
#	13-Mar-2010 (kiria01) b123422
#	    Add Unicode and Binary forms of REPLACE and corrected the
#	    symbol names and descriptions for some of the longtext functions
#	    to reduce confusion.
#	18-Mar-2010 (kiria01) b123438
#	    Added SINGLETON aggregate for scalar sub-query support.
    
#       23-Mar-2010 (hanal04) Bug 122436
#           Change ADFI_164_LOCATE_STR_STR to ADFI_164_LOCATE_ALL_ALL
#           and cloaked ADFI_165_LOCATE_UNISTR_UNISTR. C to VARCHAR
#           coercion was stripping trailing from p2 which is not the
#           documented behaviour.
#       0l-apr-2010 (stial01)
#           Changes for Long IDs
#	27-Apr-2010 (kschendel)
#	    One more db-maxname fix, in iipermittype.

#	10-May-2010 (kschendel) b123712
#	    Add FI's for float ceil, floor, trunc.
#       10-May-2010 (horda03) B123704
#           MONEY MUL/DIV 'string' (e.g. '$1.0') fails with E_US100F (a
#           string coersion error). Add ADFI_1466_MONEY_DIV_VARCHAR,
#           ADFI_1467_VARCHAR_MUL_MONEY,  ADFI_1468_MONEY_DIV_VARCHAR and
#           ADFI_1469_VARCHAR_MUL_MONEY so that the FI instance doesn't
#           operators with string vs string added ADFI_1470_VARCHAR_DIV_VARCHAR
#           and ADFI_1471_VARCHAR_MUL_VARCHAR.
#       13-May-2010 (horda03) B123704
#           Removed ADFI_1470_VARCHAR_DIV_VARCHAR and ADFI_1471_VARCHAR_MUL_VARCHAR
#           E_AD2063 need an alternate way. Really only want to select the
#           FI 1466 thru 1469 when one of the data type is money and the other
#           is a string, so these FI have either ADI_F65536_PAR1MATCH or
#           ADI_F131072_PAR2MATCH flag set, meaning that they will only be
#           considered if the appropriate parameter is MONEY.
#	3-jun-2010 (stephenb)
#		Fix ADFI_1457_NVL2_ANY with correct return type and new
#		lenspec. (Bug 123880)
#       15-Jun-2010 (horda03) B123926
#           Add IFNULL FI for LONG VARCHAR and LONG BYTE.
