    ** Parameters:

    ** Explanation:
    **  The only way to access a private database is to be explicately
    **  permitted to access the db via a tuple in iidbaccess.  CREATEDB 
    **  puts a tuple in iidbaccess for the DBA of a private database at

/*%
    **	Parameters:
    **	    none.
    **	Explanation:
    **	    VERIFYDB was not able to open the VERIFYDB log file (currently

    **	    someone else is running a VERIFYDB session and is using that log
    **	    file.  If you wait a while and try again, it will probably work.
    **	    If you would rather not wait, it is possible to run VERIFYDB 
    **	    without the log file (I don't recommend this as a regular practice)
    **	    by using the -n flag before any of the other VERIFYDB parameters.
    **	    Example:  if your command line was
    **			VERIFYDB -mruni -sdbn test1 -odbms
    **		then type:
    **			VERIFYDB -n -mruni -sdbn test1 -odbms
    **	System Status:
    **	    VERIFYDB considers it an error if it is unable to open its log
    **	    file.  In such a case, VERIFYDB will print this error message and
    **	    terminate processing.  VERIFYDB will never print this error if the
    **	    -n flag is used.
    **	User Action:
    **	    The best thing to do is to see if anyone else in the installation
    **	    is running VERIFYDB.  If so, wait til they're finished.  If not,
    **	    check the logical ii_config to assure that its valid (an undefined
    **	    or improperly defined ii_config will also cause this message.  
    ***	    Of course, you can always bypass logging by using the -n flag. 
    **	    However, VERIFYDB outputs lots of messages, so this is a last

    ** Explanation:
    **	Upgradedb is a frontend.  No frontend may run on an installation that

    **	in an installation that does not have an iidbdb since createdb is also
    **	a frontend and also cannot create any user databases until the iidbdb is
    **	first created.  It does not make sense to be using upgradedb if you do
    **	not have databases to upgrade, so let us assume that you have an
    **	installation problem.  Common things will will make it impossible for
    **	the system to find the iidbdb include:  1) the ii_database logical is
    **	not correctly defined (concealed device on vms), 2) the ii_database
    **	logical does not point to the correct location, 3) someone has

**	Contains the definitions for the messages and error messages of ABF.
**
** History:
**	Revision 6.0  87/08/04  bobm
**	Initial revision.
**	Revision 6.2  89/09/20  kevinm  (JupBug #7289)
**	Added two messages for the OtherLanguages menuitem,
**	F_AB002D_OtherLang_expl and F_AB002E_Other.
**
**	Revision 6.3  89/11  wong
**	Added illegal file-name message, E_AB0138.
**
**	90/03  wong  Added unsupported language message, E_AB0139.
**	23-oct-1990 (mgw)
**		Corrected some misspellings. All are in comments, not messages,
**		but these comments get picked up for the messages.txt file via
**		erxtract and are thus in a deliverable.
**	14-aug-91 (blaise)
**		Added E_AB0154_NoObjFile.
**	22-aug-91 (blaise)
**		E_AB0154_NoObjFile now only takes one argument.
**	26-feb-1992 (mgw)
**		Added E_AB0155_OSCompErr.
**	28-feb-1992 (mgw) Bug #41111
**		Made S_AB0146_ReturnChange and S_AB0148_FrameChange obsolete
**		and replaced them with S_AB0156_NewReturnChange and
**		S_AB0157_NewFrameChange respectively to have these messages
**		refer to frames or procedures as appropriate instead of just
**		frames.
**	16-Nov-1992 (donc) Bug #44162
**		Added E_AB036_BadSymbolName 
**	18-Feb-1993 (connie) Bug #48982
**		Added S_AB0158_RunHostLangProc,F_AB00BC_Title,F_AB00BD_Yestext,

The internal ABF run-time structures contain a NULL reference for the routine
for the %1c `%0c'.  Please report this internal problem to your Site Technical
Contact."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The ABF run-time system found a NULL reference to a routine in its
**	internal structures when the application tried to call or run an 4GL
**	frame or procedure.  (This routine contains the executable code for
**	the frame or procedure.)  ABF should generate a symbol for this routine,

**	Otherwise, this is an internal programming problem.
**
**	In versions before release 6, this error could occur when the source
**	files for a frame and a procedure shared a common file name but had
**	different extensions (e.g., "xyz.osl" and "xyz.c".)  Then, the resultant
**	object files would collide, most likely overwriting the code for the
**	frame's routine.  ABF guarantees that this cannot occur in release 6
**	applications by not allowing files to be specified for frames or

**		Added EQ0450-457 for forms with clause errors (EQFW Unit)
**	30-jan-88 (marian)
**		Added E_EQ0504_COMMON_WARN and added F_EQ0505_eqFL11
**		to add common sql warning messages.
**	10-feb-89 (marian)
**		Changed the wording for E_EQ0504_COMMON_WARN so it now says
**		'may not be portable' instead of 'is not portable'.

**	26-sep-89 (sylviap)
**		Changed E_EQ0505_NO_SQLDA to E_EQ0125_NO_SQLDA so as not to
**		collide with the FIPS error messages.
**      09-oct-89 (sylviap)
**              B 8174: Added E_EQ006A_grxBADWORD for DG bug.  Open SQL (DG)
**              does not allow multiple connections.  Error is very similar
**              to E_EQ0069, but no keyword is assumed.

**		Added E_EQ0512_OPEN_CLAUSE.
**	23-oct-1990 (mgw)
**		Corrected some misspellings. All are in comments, not messages,
**		but these comments get picked up for the messages.txt file via
**		erxtract and are thus in a deliverable.
**	14-feb-1991 (teresal)
**		Added E_EQ0513_OPEN_OP.
**	05-mar-1991 (barbara)

The product has run out of memory after requesting %0c bytes for internal data."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	A memory allocation or free error has occurred somewhere in
**	the code in a place where it was unexpected, or where it
**	was not possible to recover from the error.  This may indicate an
**	internal coding error or a program that is too large. 
**
** System Status:
**	The preprocessor will abort.
**
** User Action:
**	Check your system quotas.  If you suspect they might be too low, 
**	try to break up the input file or the embedded language blocks.
**	If the preprocessor still fails, call your INGRES support person.
*/

**	-t flag when invoking the preprocessor.  Under normal circumstances
**	it should not be necessary to use trace flags.
**
** System Status:
**	The preprocessor will exit without preprocessing the input file.
**
** User Action:
**	Retype the preprocessor command line using the correct flags.
*/

E_EQ0005_eqINFILE	"%0c input file '%1c' cannot be opened.\n
Error in location or name of file or you have no read permission."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The preprocessor cannot find the input file named on the command
**	line.  The location/directory path specified may be incorrect,
**	the file name itself may be incorrectly entered, or the file may
**	be non-existent.  An extremely long path name will also cause this
**	error.

Check write permission and -f flag argument, if used."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	Output files cannot be opened if a user does not have write
**	privileges.  If the -f flag was specified, the location or directory
**	path given must be a legal location.  There may be other system 
**	dependent reasons why a file cannot be opened.

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The variable used to receive the result of the above FRS function 
**	has a type other than integer.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Correct the current syntax to use an integer variable which
**	has been declared to the preprocessor.
*/

E_EQ0054_grNOPARENS	"Empty parentheses are ignored.\n
No parentheses are required on empty target lists."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	Some statements have optional target lists.  In some cases, when
**	empty target lists are used, this warning is displayed. 
**
** System Status:
**	The preprocessor will ignore the parentheses and will return
**	a SUCCESS status if no other errors occur during preprocessing.
**
** User Action:
**	Remove the unnecessary parentheses.
*/

E_EQ0055_grFMPARAM	"Illegal context for PARAM clause in forms statement.\n
You may not use the PARAM clause in this statement."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	In the languages that support PARAM target lists, not all forms 
**	target lists have a PARAM equivalent.  The statements that have
**	a PARAM equivalent are documented in the preprocessor manual.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Rewrite the forms target list using host variables declared to the
**	preprocessor instead of the PARAM clause.
*/

E_EQ0056_grFORMNAME	"Form name required for %0c statement.\n
The %0c statement used outside of a DISPLAY loop requires a form name."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	A forms I/O statement that is syntactically outside of a DISPLAY
**	loop requires a form name specification.   Inside the DISPLAY
**	loop the currently displayed form is assumed if no form is
**	specified.  This error may also occur if the DISPLAY statement
**	contained a syntax error.
**	
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Check the syntax on the DISPLAY statement.  Otherwise, include a 
**	form name in the statement, or move the statement inside a DISPLAY loop.
*/

E_EQ0057_grHOSTVAR	"'%0c' expected to be a simple variable.\n
Use a scalar numeric or character string variable instead of '%0c'."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The named identifier was used in an I/O statement, but was not
**	declared to the preprocessor as a scalar numeric or character
**	string variable.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Declare the identifier as a variable to the preprocessor.
*/

E_EQ0058_grINLOOP	"The %0c statement must be in a %1c loop.\n"

/*%
** Explanation:
**	Some statements (such as ENDLOOP) that syntactically belong inside
**	a specific loop or block cannot be issued outside the loop or
**	or block, as they generate host language GOTO statements.  Also, a
**	syntax error on the block or loop statement will cause this error
**	to occur on subsequent statements.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Correct any bad syntax on the block (ie, DISPLAY) statement.
**	Otherwise, move the statement producing the error inside the correct
**	block statement.
*/

E_EQ0059_grINT	"Integer variable, constant or literal expected.\n
The identifier '%0c' was used instead of an integer value."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The current statement requires an integer value or variable.  You 
**	have used a non-integer variable or an identifier which has not been
**	declared to the preprocessor as a variable.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

**	You have used a variable of some other type than integer.  The
**	current statement requires the use of an integer variable.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Substitute an integer variable for the wrongly-typed variable.
*/

E_EQ0062_grNAME	"Variable '%0c' used when name expected.\n
Try dereferencing the variable name by preceding it with a '#'."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	This is a common error in EQUEL, where an object name (ie, database
**	column or form field) has the same name as a numeric variable.
**	The preprocessor will never issue this error when a character string 
**	variable is used because object names can be stored inside string 
**	variables.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Dereferencing the variable with the # sign will cause the name
**	to be used and not the contents of the named variable.
*/

E_EQ0063_grNESTQUEL	"Illegal nesting of database statements.\n
The '%0c' statement appears in a data retrieval query loop."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	This error occurs when a database query is coded within the
**	scope of a database data retrieval loop statement (SELECT or RETRIEVE).
**	The statements that may be placed within the data retrieval loop are
**	forms statements, the INQUIRE/SET status statements and the loop break 
**	statements (ENDSELECT or ENDRETRIEVE).
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Move the flagged statement outside the scope of the data retrieval
**	loop.
*/

E_EQ0064_grQRSTRVAR	"'%0c' expected to be a character string variable.\n
Query text can be replaced only by string variables."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	When replacing parts of a query, such as a WHERE clause, the
**	specified replacement must be a string variable.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Replace the variable marked as an error with a string variable
**	declared to the preprocessor.
*/

E_EQ0065_grRETREPEAT	"Incorrect use of '@' on REPEAT statement variable.\n
The '@' is a valid prefix only on variables that replace QUEL constants."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	A common error in the REPEAT RETRIEVE statement is to use the
**	@ sign on result variable names.  The @ sign can only prefix variables
**	to be sent to the database as constant values.  In the RETRIEVE case,
**	the @ sign can be correctly used in the WHERE clause.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Remove the @ sign from variables that do not replace QUEL constants.
*/

E_EQ0066_grSTR	"String constant expected instead of '%0c'."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	Either a numeric variable or an unquoted name was used instead

**	to retrieve results or replace a string literal.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Substitute a character string variable, declared to the preprocessor,
**	for the name flagged as an error.
*/

E_EQ0068_grUNLOADTB	"Illegal nesting of UNLOADTABLE statements.\n
You may not code an UNLOADTABLE statement within the scope of another
UNLOADTABLE statement."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	Because of run-time implementation considerations, an UNLOADTABLE
**	statement cannot appear within the block of another UNLOADTABLE.
**	Note that the dynamic nesting of UNLOADTABLE statements (ie, via
**	a subroutine call) is also not allowed and will cause a run-time error.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Code UNLOADTABLE statements consecutively instead of nesting them.

E_FG0001_Unknown_VQ_Var	"Error occurred while generating 4gl code\n
Found bad Visual Query variable in ##IF stmt\n
An error occurred trying to generate 4gl code for this frame.
The ##IF statement on line %0d of template file '%1c' contains a
reference to '%2c',
which is either an unknown Visual Query variable, or is a Visual Query
variable that does not evaluate to TRUE or FALSE (only boolean Visual
Query variables may be used in ##IF statements). This is an error in your
template file; correct the template file '%1c' before trying to generate
4gl again."

E_FG0002_IfStmt_Nesting  "Error occurred while generating 4gl code\n
An error occurred trying to generate 4gl code for this frame.
##IF/##IFDEF/##ENDIF blocks may only be nested up to %0d levels deep.
Line %1d of template file '%2c' contains a ##IF or ##IFDEF statement which,
if executed, would have exceeded this limit. This is an error in your template
file; correct the template file '%2c' before trying to generate 4gl again."

E_FG0003_Mismatch_ElseEndif	"Error occurred while generating 4gl code\n
Template file error: mismatched ##ELSE or ##ENDIF.
An error occurred trying to generate 4gl code for this frame.
On line %0d of template file '%1c', a ##ELSE or ##ENDIF statement was
encountered that does not match any previous ##IF or ##IFDEF statement.
This is an error in your template file; correct the template file '%1c'
before trying to generate 4gl again."

E_FG0004_Too_Many_Elses	"Error occurred while generating 4gl code\n
Template file error: too many ##ELSE stmts found.
Line %0d of template file '%1c' contains a duplicate ##ELSE statement. A
##ELSE statement has already been seen for the previous ##IF/##IFDEF statement,
so this duplicate ##ELSE is an error in the template file '%1c'. Correct the
template file before trying to generate 4gl again."

An error occurred trying to generate 4gl code for this frame: neither
of the environment variables II_CONFIG or II_TFDIR are set. One of these
must be set to the directory where the template files live. Before continuing
you must first set one of these environment variables to point to where your
template files are. If you are not sure how to do that, then contact your Site
Technical Contact for assistance."

E_FG0006_Open_Error	"Error occurred while generating 4gl code\n
Unable to open output file for generated code.
An error occurred trying to generate 4gl code for this frame: the output
file '%0c' could not be opened. Check that you have sufficient disk space
and quota on this directory, and that you have authority to create files there."

E_FG0007_IncludeStmt_Nesting	"Error occurred while generating 4gl code\n
##INCLUDE statements nested too deep.
An error occurred generating 4gl code for this frame. The statement
'##INCLUDE %0c' was encountered, and cannot be processed, because that
would exceed the limit of %1d levels deep in ##INCLUDE file processing. Often
an infinite loop in your ##INCLUDE file processing will cause this error (for
example if file1 does '##INCLUDE file2', and file2 does '##INCLUDE file1',
then an infinite loop will occur). Check your template files for an
infinite loop in ##INCLUDE statements, or ##INCLUDE statements nested more
than %1d levels deep."

##ENDIF missing for ##IF or ##IFDEF in template file.
An error occurred generating 4gl code for this frame. Template file
'%0c' has an error: it contains at least one ##IF or ##IFDEF statement that
is not closed by a corresponding ##ENDIF statement in the same file. This is an
error in the template file and should be corrected before proceeding. If
you don't know how to correct an error in a template file, then contact
your Site Technical Contact for assistance."

/*%
** Parameters:
**	%0c	Internal name of message buffer (for example GCA_TUPLES).
**	%1c	Size of message buffer in bytes.
**
** Explanation:
**	During a pre-fetch operation (for example, when fetching multiple rows
**	of data from a read-only cursor), the run-time system attempts to
**	allocate unread message buffers to improve the performance of
**	subsequent retrievals against the same data.  When trying to allocate
**	one such buffer the system encountered a memory failure.  This is
**	normally due to memory resources being exhausted for the process.
**	
** System Status:
**	The run-time system aborts the current operation.  If this is a cursor

**	a number of "following" pre-fetched rows will have been discarded.
**
** User Action:
**	Confirm that you are not encountering unrelated memory errors that
**	could be due to your program corrupting the internal memory management
**	lists.  If this only occurs when trying to pre-fetch data then maybe
**	the system has exhausted all memory.  For example, a large number of
**	read-only cursors all open at the same time, all having set
**	the PREFETCHROWS value to a very large number, may encounter this

/*%
** Parameters:
**	%0c	Internal name of message buffer (for example GCA_TUPLES).
**	%1c	Number of rows originally requested for pre-fetch operation.
**	%2c	Number of rows encountered so far.
**
** Explanation:
**	During a pre-fetch operation (for example, when fetching multiple rows
**	of data from a read-only cursor), the run-time system collects unread
**	rows from the DBMS and saves them away for subsequent retrievals.
**	The requested number of rows (determined by the PREFETCHROWS setting or

**	
**	A message type of GCA_TUPLES indicates that the actual data exceeded
**	the row count.  A message type of GCA_RESPONSE indicates that the
**	internal DBMS response count exceeded the value, though the data may
**	have been correct (this latter problem is less severe).
**

/**
** Name:	eros.msg -	4GL Translator Message Definitions File.
**
** Description:
**	Contains the definitions for messages and error messages for
**	the 4GL translators.
**
** History:
**	Revision 6.4/03
**	09/20/92 (emerson)
**		Refined the text of E_OS0153 slighty: it said "table field"
**		when it should have said "table field, record, or array".
**		Also reworded the text of E_OS0155 and E_OS0210: target list
**		items can be variables and (for E_OS0210) attributes
**		as well as fields and (for E_OS0210) table field columns.
**		Also changed "attached query" to "query" in several messages.
**		Added E_OS015C_BadColonInSelectTarget (for bugs 38299 and 44004)
**
**	Revision 6.4/02
**	10/09/91 (emerson)
**		Added comment to the effect that E_OS0257
**		has been superseded by E_OS0260.
**		Refined the E_OS0260 message.
**	12/16/91 (emerson)
**		Integrated a change from the PC group to add a new-line
**		to the beginning of the "No errors" message (S_OS0008).
**		This provides consistency with other OSL compiler completion
**		messages.
**
**	Revision 6.4
**	03/13/91 (emerson)
**		Added E_OS0050_BadDecimal (for bad II_4GL_DECIMAL).
**	04/07/91 (emerson)
**		Modifications for local procedures:
**		Modified E_OS0024 and added E_OS0060 through E_OS0068
**		and E_OS016F.
**	04/22/91 (emerson)
**		Added E_OS017C thru E_OS017F for alerter support.
**	05/07/91 (emerson)
**		More modifications for local procedures:
**		Added messages E_OS016D and E_OS016E.
**	09-may-91 (mgw)
**		Added E_OS0132 for syntax error on COPY 'with null' clause.
**		Also corrected typos and moved a commented Explanation back
**		to the error message it describes.
**	06/20/91 (emerson)
**		Added E_OS000A_TypeMismatch (for bug 38203).
**	07/22/91 (emerson)
**		Added E_OS0266_ProcInVar (for bug 38753).
**	07/25/91 (emerson)
**		Added E_OS0267_CallProcSysFunc (for bug 38849).
**	02-aug-1991 (davel)
**		Added E_OS0268_BadTblFld (for bug 35665).
**	08/04/91 (emerson)
**		Provided support for the user to manually issue the osl
**		or oslsql command:  Added E_OS000B thru E_OS000D
**		and changed the wording of E_OS0000 (it can now be
**		a user error).  Also changed the explanatory comments
**		for E_OS0002.
**	08/06/91 (emerson)
**		Added E_OS0269_BadDbmsinfo for bug 21745.
**	08/15/91 (emerson)
**		Added E_OS015A_BadRepeat and E_OS015B_QualRepeat for bug 35468.
**		Also fixed E_OS0159 to reflect the fact that query objects
**		can be arrays or records.
**
**	Revision 6.0  87/08/03  wong
**	Initial revision.
**	10-feb-89 (marian)
**		Added E_OS0224 for conversion warning messages.

The label '%0c' has already been defined in this frame or procedure.  Label
names must be unique."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The frame or 4GL procedure already has a label with the same name
**	as the label that is being defined at this point.  Because this is
**	ambiguous, you should use a different name for this label.
**
** System Status:

** Explanation:
**	The label referenced in an ENDLOOP statement was not defined for any

/*%
** Explanation:
**	Certain statements in 4GL implicitly assume that a form is associated

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The named 4GL variable (a table field, record, array, constant or global

** Explanation:
**	Any RESUME directly inside an alerter activation must have no operands.
**
** System Status:
**	The source file will be checked for other errors but will not be
**	compiled.
**
** User Action:
**	Remove the RESUME or change it to a RESUME with no operands.
*/

E_OS017F_MissingActs	"Missing activations.\n
A frame or submenu must have at least one non-alerter activation."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	A frame or submenu must have at least one non-alerter activation.
**	The menu or submenu either has no activations at all
**	(which probably means you have other syntax errors as well),
**	or it has only an alerter event activation.
**
** System Status:
**	The source file will be checked for other errors but will not be
**	compiled.
**
** User Action:
**	Add an activation to the frame or submenu.

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The named hidden field was declared with a NULL clause (WITH NULL

**
** User Action:

A procedure name specified via a variable cannot be used inside an expression."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	A procedure whose name was specified in a string variable

**
** User Action:
**	Assign the result of the procedure call to a variable whose type

**	the variable instead of the procedure call in the expression.
**	For example:  Suppose the logic of your application ensures
**	that the variable PROCNAME (of type VARCHAR(8)) may contain

**
** User Action:
**	Remove the keyword CALLPROC: code 
**
**		result = system_func(...)
**
**	instead of
**
**		result = CALLPROC system_func(...)
**
**	Alternatively, if you intended to override the system function
**	with a procedure of your own, create the procedure.

E_OS0269_BadDbmsinfo	"Warning: invalid use of DBMSINFO\n
The system function DBMSINFO is intended for use only inside a DBMS statement
(such as a SELECT).  When used elsewhere, it generally will return the empty
string."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	DBMSINFO is intended for use only inside a DBMS statement.
**
** System Status:
**	The 4GL compilation will continue.
**
** User Action:
**	In general, place the invocation of DBMSINFO inside a SELECT.
**	For example, if v is a VARCHAR variable, code
**
**		SELECT v = DBMSINFO('username');
**
**	instead of
**
**		v = DBMSINFO('username');
**
**	One possible exception is DBMSINFO('_bintim').  Outside a DBMS
**	statement, this has, in prior releases, returned the current time
**	on the machine which is running your application, expressed as
**	the number of seconds elapsed since Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 G.M.T.
**	(This has never been a supported feature).  If you code
**
**		SELECT v = DBMSINFO('_bintim');
**
**	you'll get the current time on the DBMS server machine,
**	which may be different from the current time on the machine
**	which is running your application.  To get the latter time, code
**
**		v = VARCHAR(INT4(INTERVAL('sec', 'now' -

For tables like this one that do not have a unique key, every column in the
table is used as the unique key. If all columns are displayed, then every
one will appear twice in the list of selected columns. This
