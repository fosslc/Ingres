** Explanation:

**	ABF (or ABFIMAGE) could not create an object code directory sub-tree

The internal ABF run-time structures contain a NULL reference for the routine

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The ABF run-time system found a NULL reference to a routine in its
**	internal structures when the application tried to call or run an 4GL

**	In versions before release 6, this error could occur when the source

** Explanation:
**	This message tells how many objects there are of a given type

**
** Parameters:
** 	%0c  =	object type name (such as FORM, REPORT, etc.)
**	%1c  =	count of how many objects of that type
**		(Note that %1c preceeds %0c in the message format.)
**	
**	(Note that an 'S' is appended to %0c, and the object type name
**	is assumed to be uppercase.  If this is translated to a language
**	where the plural cannot be represented by appending something,
**	then the message will have to be changed to something like;
**	"nnn FORM objects to be converted." so that the singular object

E_DM9387_INDEX_UPDATE_ERROR
"Update failed due to inability to update secondary index table."

** Explanation:
**	An update was made on a table that has a secondary index.  A failure
**	occurred attempting to update the corresponding secondary index entry.
** System Status:

E_DM9388_BAD_DATA_LENGTH
"Character data value in row has an illegal length descriptor - length is %0d."
/*
** Parameters:
**	%0d	- length given in length descriptor.
** Explanation:
**	A VARCHAR or TEXT datatype has been encountered that has a length
**	descriptor that gives an impossible length.  This means this row
**	is probably trashed.  This error is probably encountered while trying
**	to compress or uncompress the tuple - in these cases the length value
**	is needed.
**
**	If the error is returned on an insert, then the bad row will not be
**	added to the database.  If this error is returned on a select, then
**	the bad row is probably already in the database.
** System Status:
**	Query will be rejected in normal case and the transaction aborted.
**	These actions can be altered by trace flags desribed below.
** User Action:
**	This error probably indicates a bad row.  If this error is returned on
**	a select, then the table needs to be fixed.  Following this error should
**	be an E_DM938A_BAD_DATA_ROW error that will give the TID of the bad
**	row.  The user should attempt to select the row by TID to verify that
**	this row is really unable to be returned from the database.
**
**	The table probably needs some type of recovery to fix the bad row.
**	See the User Action described below on error E_DM938A_BAD_DATA_ROW.
*/
E_DM9389_BAD_DATA_VALUE
"Bad data value encountered in row of database."
/*
** Parameters:
**	None.
** Explanation:
**	A bad data value was encountered in the database that could not be
**	interpreted by DMF.  This error should be followed by an E_DM938A
**	error which indicates the TID of the bad tuple.
**
**	If the error is returned on an insert, then the bad row will not be
**	added to the database.  If this error is returned on a select, then
**	the bad row is probably already in the database.
** System Status:
**	Query will be rejected and the transaction aborted.
** User Action:
**	See error E_DM938A_BAD_DATA_ROW.
*/
E_DM938A_BAD_DATA_ROW
"Bad row encountered in database '%0c', table (%1c, %2c) - TID '%3d'."
/*
** Parameters:
**	%0c	- databse name
**	%1c	- table name
**	%2c	- table owner
**	%3d	- TID of bad row
** Explanation:
**	A bad row was encountered in the database that could not be
**	interpreted by DMF.
**
**	If the error is returned on an insert, then the bad row will not be
**	added to the database.  If this error is returned on a select, then
**	the bad row is probably already in the database.
** System Status:
**	Query will be rejected in normal case and the transaction aborted.
**	The error recovery actions can be altered by the trace flags below.
** User Action:
**	If this error is returned on a SELECT statement then there is probably
**	a bad row in the database.  The user should do a select by TID of the
**	reported row to make sure that it is really bad.  The table should be
**	recovered - methods for doing this are described below.
**
**	The supported method of fixing a table like this is to recover it from
**	the last checkpoint.  If this is not practical or possible, the table
**	can be patched by removing the offending row.  There are two trace
**	flags provided for this - these are undocumented trace flags that are
**	not intended to be distributed for general use!
**
**	SET TRACE POINT DM801 will cause DMF to skip bad rows like this when
**	scanning the table.  Thus the user could do
**
**		set trace point DM801
**		modify table to storage_structure
**
**	which would have the effect of rebuilding the table without any
**	of the offending rows.
**
**	SET TRACE POINT DM802 will cause DMF to return a garbage row when a
**	bad row is encountered.  This allows the user to do
**
**		set trace point DM802
**		delete table where table.tid = BAD_TID
**		set notrace point DM802
**
**	This will delete the offending row directly.  This is the only operation
**	that should be attempted while having this traceflag on as it may cause
**	unexpected and upredictable results if used while SELECTing a bad row.
*/
E_DM938B_INCONSISTENT_ROW
"Bad row encountered in database."
/*
** Parameters:
**	None.
** Explanation:
**	A bad row was encountered in the database that could not be
**	interpreted by DMF.
**
**	If the error is returned on an insert, then the bad row will not be
**	added to the database.  If this error is returned on a select, then
**	the bad row is probably already in the database.
** System Status:
**	Query will be rejected and the transaction aborted.

The product has run out of memory after requesting %0c bytes for internal
data."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	A memory allocation or free error has occurred somewhere in
**	the code in a place where it was unexpected, or where it
**	was not possible to recover from the error.  This may indicate an
**	internal coding error or a program that is too large. 
**
** System Status:
**	The preprocessor will abort.
**
** User Action:
**	Check your system quotas.  If you suspect they might be too low, 
**	try to break up the input file or the embedded language blocks.
**	If the preprocessor still fails, call your INGRES support person.

*/

E_EQ0004_eqTRACEFL	"Conflicting %0c '-to' and '-tl' options."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	This error is caused by an inconsistent use of the internal trace
**	-t flag when invoking the preprocessor.  Under normal circumstances
**	it should not be necessary to use trace flags.
**
** System Status:
**	The preprocessor will exit without preprocessing the input file.
**
** User Action:
**	Retype the preprocessor command line using the correct flags.
*/

E_EQ0005_eqINFILE	"%0c input file '%1c' cannot be opened.\n
Error in location or name of file or you have no read permission."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The preprocessor cannot find the input file named on the command
**	line.  The location/directory path specified may be incorrect,
**	the file name itself may be incorrectly entered, or the file may

** User Action:
**	Correct the syntax of the DISPLAY statement in the embedded program.
*/

E_EQ0052_grFMFUNC	"Illegal context for Forms '%0c' function.\n
You have incorrectly placed the '%0c' function within another statement."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The forms functions, such as GETOPER, which retrieves relational
**	operators from fields and table fields, may be legally used as follows:
**		GETFORM form (var = GETOPER(field), ...)
**		GETROW form table [row] (var = GETOPER(column), ...)
**	This also applies to the PUTOPER function.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Correct the syntax of the current statement.
*/

E_EQ0053_grFMINTFUNC	"Forms '%0c' function is integer valued.\n
You must use an integer variable for the result of this function."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The variable used to receive the result of the above FRS function 
**	has a type other than integer.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Correct the current syntax to use an integer variable which

*/

E_EQ0054_grNOPARENS	"Empty parentheses are ignored.\n
No parentheses are required on empty target lists."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	Some statements have optional target lists.  In some cases, when
**	empty target lists are used, this warning is displayed. 
**
** System Status:
**	The preprocessor will ignore the parentheses and will return
**	a SUCCESS status if no other errors occur during preprocessing.
**
** User Action:
**	Remove the unnecessary parentheses.
*/

E_EQ0055_grFMPARAM	"Illegal context for PARAM clause in forms statement.\n
You may not use the PARAM clause in this statement."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	In the languages that support PARAM target lists, not all forms 
**	target lists have a PARAM equivalent.  The statements that have
**	a PARAM equivalent are documented in the preprocessor manual.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Rewrite the forms target list using host variables declared to the
**	preprocessor instead of the PARAM clause.
*/

E_EQ0056_grFORMNAME	"Form name required for %0c statement.\n
The %0c statement used outside of a DISPLAY loop requires a form name."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	A forms I/O statement that is syntactically outside of a DISPLAY
**	loop requires a form name specification.   Inside the DISPLAY
**	loop the currently displayed form is assumed if no form is
**	specified.  This error may also occur if the DISPLAY statement
**	contained a syntax error.
**	
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Check the syntax on the DISPLAY statement.  Otherwise, include a 
**	form name in the statement, or move the statement inside a DISPLAY loop.
*/

E_EQ0057_grHOSTVAR	"'%0c' expected to be a simple variable.\n
Use a scalar numeric or character string variable instead of '%0c'."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The named identifier was used in an I/O statement, but was not
**	declared to the preprocessor as a scalar numeric or character
**	string variable.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Declare the identifier as a variable to the preprocessor.
*/

E_EQ0058_grINLOOP	"The %0c statement must be in a %1c loop.\n"

/*%
** Explanation:
**	Some statements (such as ENDLOOP) that syntactically belong inside
**	a specific loop or block cannot be issued outside the loop or
**	or block, as they generate host language GOTO statements.  Also, a
**	syntax error on the block or loop statement will cause this error
**	to occur on subsequent statements.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Correct any bad syntax on the block (ie, DISPLAY) statement.
**	Otherwise, move the statement producing the error inside the correct
**	block statement.
*/

E_EQ0059_grINT	"Integer variable, constant or literal expected.\n
The identifier '%0c' was used instead of an integer value."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The current statement requires an integer value or variable.  You 
**	have used a non-integer variable or an identifier which has not been
**	declared to the preprocessor as a variable.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Substitute an integer value or a variable which has been declared
**	to the preprocessor.

**	You have used a variable of some other type than integer.  The
**	current statement requires the use of an integer variable.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Substitute an integer variable for the wrongly-typed variable.
*/

E_EQ0062_grNAME	"Variable '%0c' used when name expected.\n
Try dereferencing the variable name by preceding it with a '#'."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	This is a common error in EQUEL, where an object name (ie, database
**	column or form field) has the same name as a numeric variable.
**	The preprocessor will never issue this error when a character string 
**	variable is used because object names can be stored inside string 
**	variables.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Dereferencing the variable with the # sign will cause the name
**	to be used and not the contents of the named variable.
*/

E_EQ0063_grNESTQUEL	"Illegal nesting of database statements.\n
The '%0c' statement appears in a data retrieval query loop."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	This error occurs when a database query is coded within the
**	scope of a database data retrieval loop statement (SELECT or RETRIEVE).
**	The statements that may be placed within the data retrieval loop are
**	forms statements, the INQUIRE/SET status statements and the loop break 
**	statements (ENDSELECT or ENDRETRIEVE).
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Move the flagged statement outside the scope of the data retrieval
**	loop.
*/

E_EQ0064_grQRSTRVAR	"'%0c' expected to be a character string variable.\n
Query text can be replaced only by string variables."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	When replacing parts of a query, such as a WHERE clause, the
**	specified replacement must be a string variable.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Replace the variable marked as an error with a string variable
**	declared to the preprocessor.
*/

E_EQ0065_grRETREPEAT	"Incorrect use of '@' on REPEAT statement variable.\n
The '@' is a valid prefix only on variables that replace QUEL constants."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	A common error in the REPEAT RETRIEVE statement is to use the
**	@ sign on result variable names.  The @ sign can only prefix variables
**	to be sent to the database as constant values.  In the RETRIEVE case,
**	the @ sign can be correctly used in the WHERE clause.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Remove the @ sign from variables that do not replace QUEL constants.
*/

E_EQ0066_grSTR	"String constant expected instead of '%0c'."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	Either a numeric variable or an unquoted name was used instead
**	of a string variable or quoted string.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Use quotation marks around the flagged name or a string variable.
*/

E_EQ0067_grSTRVAR	"Object named '%0c' should be a character string variable."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The current statement requires the use of a character string variable
**	to retrieve results or replace a string literal.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Substitute a character string variable, declared to the preprocessor,
**	for the name flagged as an error.
*/

E_EQ0068_grUNLOADTB	"Illegal nesting of UNLOADTABLE statements.\n
You may not code an UNLOADTABLE statement within the scope of another
UNLOADTABLE statement."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	Because of run-time implementation considerations, an UNLOADTABLE
**	statement cannot appear within the block of another UNLOADTABLE.
**	Note that the dynamic nesting of UNLOADTABLE statements (ie, via
**	a subroutine call) is also not allowed and will cause a run-time error.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Code UNLOADTABLE statements consecutively instead of nesting them.
*/

E_EQ0069_grBADWORD	"Illegal word '%0c' in %1c statement.\n
The keyword %2c is assumed."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	Some statements have words that are reserved only within the
**	context of the statement.  Misspelling or misplacing the word
**	will generate the above message.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Update the statement to use the correct keyword.
*/

E_EQ0070_grMISSWORD	"Missing word '%0c' in %1c statement."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	Some statements have "noise" words or operators that are expected
**	in some contexts.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**  	Update the statement to reflect the correct syntax.
*/

E_EQ0071_grASSGNOP	"Assignment operator should be '=', not '%0c'."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	This statement requires the use of the equals sign to indicate
**	that the value from a field in a form is to be assigned to a 
**	program variable.  Some older versions of the preprocessor allowed
**	other words (IS, BY) in this context.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Correct the statement to use the '=' assignment operator.
*/

E_EQ0072_grNONULL	"Incorrect use of indicator variable.\n
Indicators may be used only in conjunction with host program variables."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	This error occurs when a null indicator is used with a variable 
**	or identifier representing an object name.  Null indicators may be 
**	used only on I/O statements in conjunction with program variables
**	transmitting data.  Their purpose is to send/receive null data
**	to or from the database or a form .
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Remove the flagged null indicator from the current statement.
*/

E_EQ0073_grINDVAR	"Indicator variable '%0c' must be a 2-byte integer."

**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Use an indicator variable which has been declared to the preprocessor
**	as a 2-byte integer.
*/

E_EQ0074_grMISVAR	"Incorrect use of variable '%0c' in '%1c' statement."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	You have used a variable together with names or string literals
**	in a context where the preprocessor expects either a single 
**	character variable, a string literal, or one or more unquoted
**	identifiers.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Correct the syntax so that the clause in question appears as
**	unquoted identifiers, a quoted string literal or a string
**	variable.
*/

E_EQ0075_grFUTUNSUPP	"The '%0c' statement will be discontinued.\n
Future releases of the preprocessor will not support this statement."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	Refinements to the query language and forms system statements

E_EQ0128_sqNOSQLCA	"No INCLUDE SQLCA statement seen so far.\n
An INCLUDE SQLCA statement must precede a WHENEVER statement."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	In response to the WHENEVER statement, the preprocessor generates

E_LS0111_F8TOPACK	"Overflow error converting numeric string %0c from an 
internal FLOAT8 to a COBOL COMP-3 data-item with PICTURE %1c."
/*%
** Arguments:
**	%0 - Digit stream extracted from the internal FLOAT8.
**	%1 - PICTURE string for data-item.
**
** Explanation:
**	When retrieving from INGRES into a COMP or COMP-3 scaled data-item
**	the preprocessor uses a temporary internal floating-point data-item
**	and then generates a conversion call to convert that temporary
**	value into your data-item.  When executing this conversion the
**	system failed as the digit stream was too large to fit into 
**	your data-item.
**
**	Note that scaled COMP data items are assigned from an internal COMP-3
**	data item after the above conversion.
**
** System Status:
**	The value in the digit stream is truncated from the left to allow
**	it to fit.  This is not the same as the COBOL Standard Alignment Rules.
**
** User Action:
**	Provide a larger data-item to include the significant digits
**	that are being truncated.
*/

E_LS0112_STRTOF8	"Error converting numeric string %0c into an

/*%
** Arguments:
**	%0 - Digit stream generated by the COBOL preprocessor
**
** Explanation:
**	On an assignment statement from COBOL into the INGRES run-time
**	system, a floating-point literal was used.  The preprocessor 
**	generates a conversion from the literal to an internal floating-point
**	using a run-time conversion.  The generated numeric string could
*	not be correctly converted.
**
** System Status:
**	The value is not converted and 0.0 is used instead.
**
** User Action:
**	Recheck the floating-point literal (and, if necessary, the
**	generated COBOL code).

E_LS0113_CALLPACK	"Invalid COBOL CALL '%0c' USING FLOAT-8, COMP-3,\n

/*%
** Arguments:
**	%0 - The conversion procedure that was called.
**	%1 - The extra arguments that were used.
**	%2 - The argument number and the reason the argument is invalid.
**
** Explanation:
**	Some C routines have been provided to allow you to use COMP-3
**	data-items with INGRES.  Normally the preprocessor hides this
**	interface from you, but in some cases, such as Dynamic SQL, this
**	interface is hard-coded.  In that case all arguments are validated
**	before any conversion take place.  The rules associated with these
**	interfaces are described in the INGRES Embedded COBOL manuals.
**	The called routine has detected an inconsistency.
**
** System Status:
**	The conversion does not take place and the result data is not
**	modified.
**
** User Action:
**	Recheck the hard-coded call and validate your arguments.

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The FormIndex command could not successfully connect to the named
**	database most likely because the database does not exist, or possibly
**	because the commands specified using the ING_SET environment logical
**	are in error.
**
**	Occasionally, successful database connection may be precluded by

**	of installation problem or hardware or system failure.
**
** System Status:
**	Program terminates.
**
** User Action:
**	Check that the database exists and create it if it does not.  If the
**	database name was specified on the command line, check that it was
