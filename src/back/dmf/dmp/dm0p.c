/**
**
**  Name: DM0P.C - Buffer Pool Manager.
**
**  Description:
**      This module implements the buffer manager for DMF.  It manages the flow
**	of pages from disk to memory to a transaction back to memory and
**	potentially back to disk.  This management takes into account the
**	presence of multiple servers using the same resources without the
**	benefit of shared memory.  The multiple copy synchronization is handled
**	by keeping server locks on pages and maintaining version information
**	with these locks.
**
**	The cache lock protocol for coordinating multiple servers works as
**	follows:
**
**	    When a page is being read in a IX lock is held on the page.
**	    When a page is being written to a SIX lock is held on the page.
**	    When a page is not being read or written a IS lock is held on page.
**
**	    When a page is referenced and it is not owned by a transaction, the
**		lock is converted from IS to IX to get the new value stored with
**		the lock.  If the value is different then the value used to read
**		the page into the cache, then the page is reread from disk and
**		the new value is saved.  The lock mode is returned to IS.
**
**	    When a page is written the lock mode is converted to SIX, the page 
**		is written, the value is incremented, and the lock mode is 
**	        returned to IS and the new value is set.
**
**	    This protocol guarantees that:
**		all reads for a page wait for any write to complete;
**		a write waits for any reads to complete;
**		a value block check waits for any write to complete;
**		a write waits for a value block check to complete.
**
**	Cache locking is controlled by the characteristics of the database.  If
**	    the database was added to the server for exclusive use, cache locks
**	    are not needed, otherwise cache locking is enabled.  All system
**	    catalog pages for SCONCUR tables are always cache locked, because of
**	    the needed to recognize that the recovery process might have changed
**	    a page because system catalog pages are only physically locked.
**
**
** Pass Abort 
** ----------
** 
** Pass Abort is the procedure through which the DBMS server asks the RCP
** to perform a transaction abort.  It is used as a fault-tolerant mechanism
** to make another attempt at transaction recovery before failing.
** 
** Simple transaction abort processing is normally performed by the server.
** The RCP will normally only perform recovery on system or server failures.
** 
** When a server fails in its attempt to abort a transaction, however, it
** will issue a Pass Abort.  It signals the RCP to abort the transaction.
** 
** (Interesting note:  After the server has signalled the RCP, it simply
** returns to the user that the abort was successful.  Since the locks on
** the data are still held, nobody (including this user) may access the
** transient data until the transaction abort is completed.)
** 
** Should the RCP fail in its attempt to abort the transaction, the database 
** will be marked inconsistent, and all users of the database will be kicked
** out.
** 
** The Buffer manager will handle data in two modes : single-cache or
** multi-cache (used to be single-server/multi-server until shared caches were
** invented).
** 
** (Note: While single vs. multi server mode may only be configured at the
** Server Level, the buffer manager actually makes this decision on a
** database-by-database case.  Some databases may be served in single-cache
** mode while others are served in multi-cache mode.  The IIDBDB is currently
** always handled in multi-cache mode.  In the rest of this note I generally
** ignore the above and discuss the cache as though it always serves only one
** database.)
** 
** Cache Locking
** -------------
** 
** In multi-cache mode, the buffer manager uses cache-lock protocols to
** resolve issues of concurrent access of pages and cache invalidation.  With
** each page in the cache is a corresponding cache lock and a lock value.
** 
** Each time a page is referenced, the cache lock is re-requested to check
** its current lock value.  If the value is unchanged, then the page is assumed
** to be valid; otherwise the page is reread.
** 
** Whenever the cache updates a page, the page must be written to disk and
** its cache lock value updated.  This will serve to invalidate the page in
** other server caches.
** 
** Whenever the cache writes a page, it converts its cache lock to an exclusive
** mode to prevent other caches from concurrently reading the page.  The X
** lock is converted back down (and the lock value changed) as soon as the IO
** has completed.
** 
** 
** Fast Commit
** -----------
** 
** In single-cache mode, the buffer manager assumes that all pages in its
** cache may be referenced only through itself.  That is that no other servers
** using a different cache may open the same database and reference data.
** 
** Because of this assumption, the cache is not required to force out dirty
** pages when they are unlocked.  It may keep dirty pages cached since anyone
** requesting the pages will just use the cached version.
** 
** Single cache mode is required when using fast commit.
** 
** In single-cache mode the buffer manager does not (normally) need cache lock
** mechanisms which check/cause page invalidation and prevent concurrent IO's.
** 
** 
** RCP Interaction with Single Cache Mode
** ---------------------------------------
** 
** The Buffer Manager's single-cache handling becomes more complicated when
** Pass Aborts are factored in.
** 
** When a Pass Abort is signalled, the RCP will open the database in order
** to abort the affected transaction.  In doing so the RCP will violate the
** server's assumption that no other caches will access the same database.
** The RCP will be opening and accessing data in its cache at the same time
** the DBMS server is accessing the same database.
** 
** The bulk of the pass-abort cache issues are resolved through page locking.
** Since all pages which require abort work should be locked by the aborting
** transaction, we are assured that in most cases the RCP and server will
** not be acting on the same pages concurrently.  The Pass Abort
** protocol calls for the server to force and toss all pages belonging to the
** aborting transaction.  These pages are then protected by page locks and
** cannot be read back into the server cache until the transaction abort is
** complete.
** 
** The following are exceptions and complications to this scheme:
** 
**      Some pages may be updated by a transaction, but do not remain locked/
** 	owned by that transaction.  These pages may continue to be accessed by
** 	the server concurrent with the RCP's use.
** 
** 	Additionally, since these pages are not "owned" by the abort
** 	transaction (ownership is a buffer manager term - when a page is
** 	updated by a transaction, it is placed on that transaction's page
** 	queue - meaning it is owned by the transaction.  This makes it easy
** 	to find all pages which were touched by a particular xact), they
** 	are harder to track down to execute the force and toss semantics.
** 
** 	These pages currently include:
** 
** 	    Core System Catalog Pages
** 	    FMAP and FHDR Pages
** 	    Btree Index Pages
** 
**      When using readlock=nolock, pages may be faulted into the cache without
** 	acquiring page locks.  This allows us to read pages into the cache
** 	that may be being updated by the RCP.
** 
**      Group reads can cause pages to be faulted into the cache without
** 	acquiring pages locks in the same way that readlock=nolock does.
** 	This is because only the first page of the group is actually locked.
** 
** Code Design
** ------------
** 
** Pass abort code must be concerned with three processing intervals:
** 1) when pass abort is initially signalled; 
** 2) when the RCP is actually performing Pass Abort recovery; 
** 3) when the RCP completes Pass Abort. 
** 
** Prior to signalling the RCP to start Pass Abort processing, the
** server first invalidates all cache pages associated with the failed 
** transaction, then tosses all pages from its cache that it thinks 
** the RCP might need during Pass abort processing.  This is because 
** if the server is using fast commit, it is not verifying the 
** correctness of pages in its cache that may have been invalidated 
** by the RCP.  
** 
** Next, the server calls LG to let the RCP know that a Pass Abort 
** has occurred.  Then the server sets the buffer manager status 
** to BMCB_PASS_ABORT, entering the state where "PAWRITE" processing is 
** enabled.
** 
** Page types requiring special handling during Pass Abort are those 
** noted above:
** 
**     o Core System Catalog Pages
**     o FMAP and FHDR Pages
**     o Read-nolock pages
**     o Group read pages
**     o Btree Root and Index Pages (at least until recovery
**       issues are fixed)
** 
** Group reads are handled in gfault_page by simply disabling them 
** when PA processing is taking place.  That is, group reads default 
** to single page reads during this interval.
** 
** Readlock-nolock pages are managed by tossing them from the cache 
** immediately after reference.  Normal caching is reenabled  
** after completion of Pass Abort.  Also, readlock-nolock pages are
** cache locked when they are faulted in during Pass Abort to 
** ensure that they are not read at the same time they are being 
** updated elsewhere.
** 
** FHDR, FMAP, Btree root and index pages are flagged as "PAWRITE" 
** (in fault_page) whenever they are brought into the cache.  Pages 
** so flagged are then handled specially during Pass Abort, as follows.
** 
** During the "toss" performed at the start of Pass Abort, 
** PAWRITE pages that are fixed or busy are marked "TUNFIX", 
** causing them to be tossed from the cache when they unfixed.
** 
** Similarly, during Pass Abort fault_page code marks PAWRITE 
** pages TUNFIX when they are are faulted in.  dm0p_unfix_page 
** tosses them from the cache.  When Pass Abort is complete, 
** fault_page no longer marks PAWRITE pages TUNFIX.
** 
** Core System Catalog Pages are currently flagged as write on
** unfix (WUNFIX), making Pass Abort actions unnecessary at this 
** time.  At some point they may be treated as normal PAWRITE pages.
**
** Distributed Multi-Cache Management (DMCM) Protocol (ICL phil.p)
** ==================================================
** 
** DMCM is effectively Fast_Commit in a Multi-Cache environment :-
** 
** When a page is fixed, it is locked at the same mode as the data page
** (X or S), except read_nolock queries where the cache page is intially
** locked at the same mode as the data page and then converted down to N.
**
** (System catalog pages do NOT participate in the DMCM protocol, they are
** written/tossed on unfix for concurrency reasons.)
**
** At the end of a transaction, the pages are not flushed, but are 
** retained in cache with the a NULL lock.
** A cached page is now only tossed when absolutely necessary; as a
** result of another protocol such as pass-abort, a consistency point or
** reclaim.
**
** A cached page is now only ever written when one of the following 
** two conditions occur :-
**
** 1. Consistency point.
** 2. A session in another server requests a lock that contends with that
**    held on a cached page.
**
** (Obviously, pages are still (written and) tossed when it is necessary
** to do so to free up space in the case because a threshold has been
** reached.)
**
** When (2) occurs, the Blocking Callback routine dm0p_dmcm_callback
** which is passed as a parameter to each LKrequestWithCallback call,
** is fired; causing force_page to be called with the appropriate flag to
** ensure that the page is retained unfixed in our cache with a NULL lock.
**
** When a server attempts to fix a page, it first checks the value
** block to see if the page has been modified since we last faulted it in.
** If the value block has changed, we fault the page in. If the value
** block hasn't changed, we can use the copy already in our cache. If the
** lock mode indicated by the current transaction is higher than the mode
** at which the cached page is already locked, then we convert up to the
** required mode.
**
** READNOLOCK pages :-
**
** Leaving read_no_lock pages locked at LK_S, may cause cache locking
** deadlock because these pages will not have data page locks 
** protecting them. (The data page locks ordinarily guarantee that
** dealock is detected at the data page level before the cache page level.)
** Therefore having copied the read_no_lock page into one of the
** read_no_lock buffers, it is necessary to drop the lock to NULL.
**
** READAHEAD/Group Reads :-
**
** For reasons of concurrency, when performing a Group Read, the first page
** is locked at the same mode as the data page and all subsequent pages are
** locked at shared. Once all pages have been read, all but the first have
** their cache locked dropped to NULL - again for concurrency reasons.
**
**=============================================================================
**  
**	NOTE: should add explanations of some of the dm0p protocols - (rogerk)
**
**	Possible Future Improvements:
**
**	 o  Reduce number of calls to DIforce if possible.  This is enormously
**		expensive on many UNIX boxes.  Minimum would be once for each 
**		file for a transaction if running without fast commit.  
**		If fast commit it must be called every time unless DIforce 
**		calls are tracked against write calls in DI.
**	 o  Log more problem information before DMD_CHECK.
**       o  If running out of locks, might try converting tables from page 
**		locking to table locking for tables other then the current 
**		table.  If would require running down the XCB chain of active 
**		RCB's which is a logical level control block.  This still 
**		wouldn't solve the whole problem because it only deals with 
**		currently open tables.
**	 o  Add DI routine that informs the group read code of the largest read
**		starting at the current block that is most likely to be 
**		completed in a single I/O request.  Most useful for multi-volume
**		support so that we don't initiate multiple reads.

**  History:
**      14-oct-1985 (derek)    
**          Created for Jupiter.
**	31-jun-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Added fast commit support.
**	    Added dm0p_cp_flush routine.
**	31-aug-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Return correct status if encounter warning in dm0p_force_pages.
**	 2-sep-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Make sure to force page in dm0p_unfix_page if mode is DM0P_WRITE.
**	30-sep-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Added write behind thread support.
**	    Added dm0p_wbflush_wait and dm0p_flush_pages routines.
**	    Added bm_wbstart, bm_wbend, bm_fcflush, bm_wbflush fields.
**	    Signal write behind threads when modify limit exceeded, wbstart
**	    limit exceeded, or when doing a consistency point.
**	31-oct-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Fixed concurrency bug in force_page caused by a buffer being
**	    force by the fast commit thread while being unfixed.  Changed
**	    force_page to determine what requeueing actions to take after
**	    write and lock requests are complete.
**	31-oct-1988 (rogerk)
**	    When put modified page on the modify priority queue, put the
**	    buffer at the end of the queue instead of the beginning.  This
**	    should cause us to do less log forces as we will generally not
**	    bump pages out of the cache immediately after modifying them.
**	10-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Integrated 6.1 bug fixes - don't bump cache locks on group buffers
**	    that are not modified.  Add numargs parm to ule_format calls.
**	28-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Integrated changes for shared buffer manager.
**	    Added routines dm0p_cpdone, dm0p_count_connections, dm0p_reclaim,
**	    dm0p_mlock, dm0p_munlock, dm0p_bmid, dm0p_toss_pages, dm0p_dbcache,
**	    dm0p_tblcache, dm0p_eset, dm0p_ewait, dm0p_erelease, reclaim_bmc.
**	    Added dbc_size, tbc_size, cache_name parms to dm0p_allocate.
**	    Added tcb parm to force_page, gforce_page routines.
**	    Broke up buffer manager control block into BMCB/LBMCB.
**	    Added allocation of shared memory in dm0p_allocate.
**	    Made BMCB position independent by taking out all pointers - made
**	    all buffer lists use index values rather than pointers.
**	    Added database and table caches.
**	    Added buffer manager lock list for cache locks.
**	    Added buffer manager lock and buffer manager id.
**	    Made buffer manager mutex a cross process semaphore.
**	    Made changes to CP flush for multi-server fast commit.
**	17-mar-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Fixed read nolock bug introduced with shared buffer manager changes.
**	27-mar-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Fixed bugs in shared buffer manager handling - redid checking for
**	    first connector to buffer manager lock.  Enabled new calls to
**	    LG/LK driver for shared buffer manager.
**	 3-apr-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Pass MULTITHREAD flag when deallocate buffer manager lock list.
**	    Don't decrement server count in dm0p_deallocate until assured we
**	    can disconnect from buffer manager successfully.
**	10-apr-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added bm_name field to hold buffer manager name.
**	    Verify cache entries in dm0p_dbcache and dm0p_tblcache.
**	    Made it a server fatal error for the buffer manger connect count
**	    to be incorrect in dm0p_count_connections.
**	    Fill in the control block header information when allocate
**	    a shared memory buffer manager.
**	15-may-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added error code parameters to dm0p_dbcache and dm0p_tblcache.
**	    Added resource limit handling in dm0p_allocate.
**	    Updated MEget_pages call to reflect CL approved interface.
**	 7-jun-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added new error messages for more informative errors when allocating
**	    shared buffer manager.
**	    Don't flush temp tables during CP.
**	26-jun-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Destroy shared memory segment when last server disconnects rather
**	    than assuming it will be destroyed by the OS.
**	    Put checks in xDEBUG and error handling code of force_page to handle
**	    case where cache_locked page is being bumped but TCB not passed in.
**	29-jun-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Release buffer manager mutex while making IO and lock calls in
**	    gfault_page.
**	10-jul-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Turn on BUF_EXTENDPAGE status when allocate a scratch page.  This
**	    status is left on until the page is forced.  This prevents the
**	    Fast Commit threads from forcing this page.  The page must be forced
**	    by the server which is doing the allocate or else DI will barf.
**	07-aug-1989 (mikem)
**	    "fault_page" change: Do not automatically turn off BUF_EXTENDPAGE 
**	    bit at bottom of page (previous code turned it off thinking it was 
**	    an error case rather than the normal path through.)
**	21-aug-1989 (rogerk)
**	    When skipping newly-extended page during a CP, be sure to increment
**	    cpindex if appropriate.  This prevents unwanted DMD_CHECKs.
**	28-aug-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Pass correct arguments to dm0p_ewait from fault_page.
**	 4-sep-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Mark group buffer as busy while writing pages or releasing locks so
**	    another thread trying to do group faults won't choose it to reclaim.
**	 5-sep-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Don't increment IOWAIT and MWAIT statistics when have to wait in CP.
**	25-sep-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Fix PASS_ABORT problems.  Don't allow non-locked pages to be brought
**	    into the cache while the RCP is doing recovery on behalf of this
**	    server.  Added dm0p_pass_abort that notifies the Buffer Manager
**	    when the RCP is going to do recovery for us.  Added routine
**	    dm0p_recover_state to check/reset this status.  Disallow group
**	    faults when in PASS_ABORT state.  Toss readnolock buffers from
**	    cache when in this state.
**	25-sep-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Make sure we put buffer on transaction list when fix it for WRITE
**	    even if the buffer is already fixed.  If the buffer is fixed only
**	    for READ then it will not be on the transaction list.
**	25-sep-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Don't lock pages in X mode if DM0P_RPHYS action is specified.  This
**	    causes us to lock BTREE index pages in X mode when table is open
**	    for write.

**	    Fix NOLOCKS bug.  When can't acquire cache lock, set status to
**	    E_DB_ERROR correctly.  Was using "==" instead of "=".
**	 2-oct-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Changed to use normal semaphore rather than cross-process semaphore
**	    when not using shared buffer manager.  On some systems, cross
**	    process semaphores cannot be used on non-shared memory.
**	 2-oct-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Fix Consistency Point Bug.  If fault in buffer while in the
**	    middle of a consistency point, mark the buffer with the current
**	    CP number.  This indicates that this buffer does not need to be
**	    flushed as part of the current CP.
**	30-oct-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Fixed uninitialized variable bug in gfault_page which caused us
**	    to not use any but the 1st page of the group read.
**	30-oct-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added handling in invalidate_page of buffers that are on the
**	    fixed queue and fixed handling of modified group buffers.
**      17-jul-90 (mikem)
**          bug #30833 - lost force aborts
**          LKrequest has been changed to return a new error status
**          (LK_INTR_GRANT) when a lock has been granted at the same time as
**          an interrupt arrives (the interrupt that caused the problem was
**          a FORCE ABORT).   Callers of LKrequest which can be interrupted
**          must deal with this new error return and take the appropriate
**          action.  Appropriate action includes signaling the interrupt
**          up to SCF, and possibly releasing the lock that was granted.
**      11-sep-1990 (jonb)
**	    Integrated ingres6301 change 280136 (rogerk):
**            Fixed shared buffer manager problem involving TCB validation.
**            There was no validation of TCB's being done when a server chose
**            a buffer to toss from the cache.  With a shared cache, it is
**            possible that another server has modifed the table and the
**            tcb held by the local table actually describes the old table
**            (and has a file descriptor for the old table).
**            The implemented fix is to write into the buffer header the tcb's
**            validation stamp - derived from its tcb lock value - each time
**            buffer is read into the cache.  Only tcb's with a matching
**            validation stamp may force these pages out of the cache.
**            Added buf_tcb_stamp to the buffer header.  Store the tcb's
**            validation stamp into it in fault_page/gfault_page.  Added new
**            arguments to dm2t_get_tcb_ptr - must now pass in buffer's
**            validation stamp in order to validate tcb.
**            Added new error message for more information when there is a
**            consistency point error.
**	12-sep-90 (jonb)
**	    Integrated ingres6301 change 280141 (rogerk):
**            Added dm0p_set_valid_stamp routine to update all cached pages
**            for a table to reflect that they are consistent with the current
**            TCB.  This is called whenever a new TCB is built.   Added checks
**            in dm0p_close_page to validate buffer tcb stamps in case we
**            are throwing away an invalid TCB.
**	17-dec-90 (jas)
**	    Smart Disk changes:  renamed 'escalate' to 'dm0p_escalate'
**	    and made it visible (non-static).
**	10-jan-91 (rachael)
**	    Added additional error messages in dm0p_unfix_page, dm0p_tran_
**	    invalidate in response to bugs 
**	 4-feb-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Changed calculation of page_count for group reads to avoid group
**	    IO's that span multi-location file boundaries.  Requesting a multi
**	    page IO that spans location boundaries takes more than one IO.
**	 4-feb-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Added 'toss_modified' argument to dm0p_toss_pages so that the
**	    trace point DM420 (toss pages from cache) can clear out modified
**	    as well as non-modified pages.
**	 4-feb-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for fixed buffer priorities.
**	    Added routines dm0p_stbl_priority, dm0p_gtbl_priority to set
**	    and get a given table's priority.
**	    Added table priority cache to remember user-set table priorities.
**		(this is needed since table priorities are not currently
**		set in the system catalogs.)
**	    Added checks in fault_page for table's priority to override the
**	    buffer manager default priorities.  Added checks for BUF_PRIOFIX
**	    before altering a buffer's priority by clock or on reference.
**	25-feb-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Added trace flag DM426 to bypass group reads and only do singles.
**	    Also did same bypass if table priority has been set by the user -
**	    this allows the pages to remain in memory with a high priority.
**	    Changed dm0p_[gs]tbl_priority to take a normal DB_TAB_ID param.
**	    Added lookup of TCB to set tcb_bmpriority in dm0p_stbl_priority.
**	19-mar-1991 (walt)
**	    Don't let E_DB_WARN status leave dm0p_tran_invalidate.  It's just
**	    internal and confuses later routines if it gets out.
**	3-may-1991 (bryanp)
**	    Make dmd_checks more useful by logging detailed error information
**	    before calling dmd_check.
**	    Add message E_DM9C08_OUT_OF_LOCKS when lock quota is exceeded.
**	19-aug-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Bug 39017:
**	    Changed checks for xact abort in escalate processing.  We do
**	    not want to escalate to table level locking during transaction
**	    recovery.  The old check thought that Set Nologging transactions
**	    were always in abort state.  Changed to actually lookup the
**	    transaction state before escalating.  Exception is when running
**	    as the RCP or CSP in which case we assume we are doing transaction
**	    recovery.  Corresponding changes were made to the SVCB and the
**	    ACP, CSP and RCP to indicate the process type so we can tell when
**	    we are running in the context of a recovery process.
**	17-oct-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Great Merge of DMF : Move 6.4 changes into 6.5.  In this case,
**	    the 6.4 version of this file was moved directly to 6.5 and the
**	    6.5 changes were merged back in:
**
**	    14-jun-1991 (Derek)
**		Added new function dm0p_bicheck() that checks whether and 
**		before-image is needed, and if one is needed what type of
**		before image should be written.  
**
**		Added DM0P_MUTEX, DM0P_FHFMSYNC, DM0P_NOLOCK flags to
**		dm0p_fixpage.  Added DM0P_MRELEASE flag to dm0p_unfixpage.
**
**		Enhanced the buffer manager protocols to handle a new class
**		of pages that can be left modified in the cache until a CP
**		or close and are not owned by a transaction.  These were added
**		to allow the new pages that contain allocation information to
**		be processed with a very low overhead.  These types of pages
**		are marked BUF_PAWRITE and must be forced if a pass-abort
**		is signaled.  Also implemted related BUF_WUNFIX buffer status
**		which indicates that the specified buffer must be written
**		when released.  Added dm0p_wpass_abort routine to force out
**		all PAWRITE buffers during a pass-abort operation.
**
**		Changed TRdisplays done throughout the code in xDEBUG blocks
**		to be activated by tracepoints as well so that code could be
**		compiled with xDEBUG without causing massive TRdisplays.
**
**		Added new session level statistic gathering.
**
**		Added support in dm0p_fixpage to handle the DM0P_CREATE option
**		on already-existing pages.
**
**		Added use of new end-of-file fields in tcb (tcb_lalloc,
**		tcb_checkeof).
**	17-oct-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Added ability to call dm0p_close_page with a secondary index TCB.
**      24-oct-1991 (jnash)
**	    Initialize local priority variable caught by LINT.
**	 3-nov-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Added fixes for File Extend recovery.
**	    Added buffer status PAUNFIX which allows us to tell whether the
**	    WUNFIX condition of a buffer is because of the type of buffer or
**	    because a pass-abort operation is in progress.  This tells us
**	    whether we can reset the WUNFIX status after the pass-abort is
**	    complete.
**	19-Nov-1991 (rmuth)
**	    Added fixes for file extend and CONCUR tables when doing readahead.
**	    When faulting in a group of pages the buf_sts for any of the pages
**	    were not being set see code for comments.
**      16-dec-1991 (bryanp)
**          Add ME_IO_MASK to MEget_pages call for shared buffer cache. This
**          indicates to DI that it is advantageous for the slaves to map this
**          memory (that way, they can perform I/O directly w/o copying).
**      06-jan-92 (jnash)
**          In gforce_page, add support for > 32 gfault pages, up to
**          DM_GFAULT_MAX_PAGES.
**      21-jan-92 (jnash)
**          Revamp Pass Abort processing to introduce generic "pawrite" pages
**          (currently FHDR/FMAP, Btree ROOT and INDEX pages).
**          PAWRITE now means "perform special Pass Abort handling"
**          which means if pass abort, toss on unfix.  Eliminate BUF_PAUNFIX,
**          add BUF_TUNFIX.
**	19-feb-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Fix error message formatting problem in dm0p_allocate().
**	    Add TCB_PEND_DESTROY to tcb_status.
**	07-apr-1992 (jnash)
**	    Add support for locking a shared DMF cache in dm0p_allocate.
**	14-may-1992 (bryanp)
**	    B44260: rcb_lk_limit should not apply during transaction abort.
**	6-jul-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Prototyping DMF.
**      08-jul-1992 (mikem)
**          Fixed code problems uncovered by prototypes.
**	22-sep-1992 (bryanp)
**	    We must have a transaction active in order to call dm0l_logforce.
**	28-sep-92 (kwatts)
**	    In dm0p_allocate, add call of CSn_semaphore to give name to 
**	    the shared cache semaphore.
**	05-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging Project.  In preparation for support of Partial
**	    TCB's for the new recovery schemes, changed references to
**	    some tcb fields to use the new tcb_table_io structure fields.
**	30-july-1992 (jnash)
**	    More Reduced Logging work.
**	      - Add page checksum routines dm0p_compute_checksum,
**		dm0p_validate_checksum, dm0p_insert_checksum, and calls 
**		to these routines.
**	      - Add trace point DMZ_BUF_MACRO(27) to disable checksum.
**	      - Add trace point DMZ_BUF_MACRO(28) to perform checksum
**		and TRdisplay errors, but will not return errors to 
**		caller. 
**	19-oct-1992 (kwatts) change from 6.4 line: 18-nov-91 (kwatts)
**	    Added DM0P_CLFORCE action to dm0p_close_page.
**	22-oct-1992 (jnash) merged 17-oct-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Some ule_format calls were passing &err_code instead of err_code.
**	26-oct-92 (rickh)
**	    Replaced references to DMP_ATTS with DB_ATTS.  Also replaced
**	    DM_CMP_LIST with DB_CMP_LIST.
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**	  - Reduced logging project: changed references to tcb fields to
**	    use new tcb_table_io structure fields.  Added support for
**	    Partial TCB's. Most buffer manager routines were changed to now 
**	    lookup tableio descriptors rather than TCB's.  This way, they
**	    can perform fix/unfix operations for routines which use partially
**	    built table descriptors.
**	  - Added new routines dm0p_cachefix_page and dm0p_uncachefix_page
**	    which take actions of fixing/unfixing pages in the cache without
**	    the transaction context assumed in dm0p_[un]fix_page.  The routines
**	    dm0p_fix_page and dm0p_unfix_page now call these new routines.
**	  - Added new routines dm0p_lock_page, dm0p_unlock_page to consolidate
**	    page locking code and so it could be called from recovery code.
**	  - Changed dm0p_mutex and dm0p_unmutex calls to take TABLE_IO args
**	    rather than TCB's.
**	  - Changed DM0P_SCRATCH page handling to not mark the new
**	    page as MODIFIED.  The page is formatted (since a garbage page
**	    cannot be left in the cache), but it is up to the caller to
**	    format the page appropriately, write the correct LSN, tran_id
**	    and sequence number, and to mark the page as modified.
**	  - Added buffer manager transaction context to be used by
**	    force_page to force the log file before writing pages.
**	  - Added buffer manager semaphore to protect usage of the
**	    above transaction context.
**	  - Removed dm0p_tran_invalidate routine.  Old users of it now use
**	    dm0p_force_pages.
**	  - Removed dm0p_invalidate routine.  Since BI recovery is no longer
**	    used, cached pages are precious and can't be indiscriminatly
**	    thrown out of the cache.
**	30-October-1992 (rmuth)
**	    - Changed use of tbio_lalloc,tbio_lpageno and tbio_checkeof.
**	    - For temporary tables use/set tbio_tmp_hw_pageno.
**	23-Oct-1992 (daveb)
**	    Attach shared semaphore for monitoring, and name the local
**	    cache semaphore too.  Note we aren't detaching the shared
**	    sem yet; not sure we need to or where the right place is.
**	14-dec-1992 (rogerk & jnash)
**	  - Reduced Logging Fixes:
**	  - Added dm0p_pagetype routine to handle newly created pages which are
**	    not handled properly in fault_page because their page type (and 
**	    special page attributes) are not yet known.
**	  - Fix bug inserting checksum on pages.
**	  - Changed fault_page routines to not set Write-on-Unfix flags on
**	    temporary tables.
**	  - Changed consistency check which looked for RELEASE actions on
**	    unfix of pages not marked as temporary locked pages to bypass
**	    temporary tables and pages fixed for read.
**	14-dec-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Include dm1b.h before dm0l.h for prototype definitions.
**	    Removed DMPP_ACC_PLV argument from dm2f_write_file.
**	27-nov-1992 (robf)
**	    Escalations are security events, in dm0p_escalate audit
**	    an escalation.
**	02-jan-1993 (jnash)
**	    More reduced logging work. Add LGreserve calls.
**      12-jan-1993 (mikem)
**          Fixed routines which were declared to return status but fell off the
**          end without returning a specific status.
**	18-jan-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Log LG/LK error codes.
**	19-jan-1993 (wolf)
**	    Remove some "^T" control characters from yesterday's integration.
**	16-feb-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Fixed shared cache partial TCB problem in dm0p_close_page.
**	18-feb-1993 (rmuth)
**	    Add dm0p_log_error this understands which messages to pass
**	    upto the higher layers this is only called from certain 
**	    routines.
**	15-mar-1993 (jnash & rogerk)
**	    Fix AV in multi-server shared cache CP's.  Don't reference through
**	    null pointer when find a buffer for which this server has no tcb.
**      26-apr-1993 (bryanp/keving/andys)
**          6.5 Cluster support:
**              Replace all uses of DM_LOG_ADDR with LG_LA or LG_LSN.
**		Added changes to allow a buffer manager to work with multiple
**		    logs. Extra have_log parameter to dm0p_allocate and 
**		    extra routine dm0p_register_loghandles
**		Use DB_FAILURE_MACRO to check return status of dm0p_reclaim
**		    as it sometimes returns E_DB_WARN which is OK in
**		    [g]fault_page
**		It's now illegal to fix more than one system catalog page for
**		    write at a time. Enforce this restriction here.
**		In before_image_check, compare the page_log_addr (which is
**		    actually an LSN) with d->dcb_backup_lsn, rather than
**		    d->dcb_backup_addr.
**		Took out special CSP process handling in page locking. The page
**		    locking behavior of CSP recovery is now handled directly
**		    by recovery code and by the locking system.
**	24-may-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Include <pc.h> before <lk.h> to pick up PID definition.
**	    Fix an error message parameter (LK_N should have been LK_IS).
**	    Improve error message logging when lock escalation fails.
**	    If DMZ_LCK_MACRO(2) is set, trace buffer manager cache locking.
**	26-mar-1993 (kwatts)
**	    Action DM0P_CLFORCE in dm0p_close_page was forcing out fixed pages
**	    onto the free chain. Changed the option to force_page so that
**	    pages simply got written in this instance.
**	24-may-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Added dm0p_1toss_page to assist in recovery tests.
**	21-may-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Changed CP flush routine to not probe each page in the cache
**	    unless necessary.  This can prevent Consistency Points from having
**	    to page in the entire buffer cache when parts of the cache have 
**	    been paged out by the Operating System.
**      21-jun-1993 (jnash)
**          Add trace point DM1308 to extend length of CP to 30 seconds.
**	14-jul-93 (ed)
**	    replacing <dbms.h> by <gl.h> <sl.h> <iicommon.h> <dbdbms.h>
**	26-jul-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Replace all uses of DM_LKID with LK_LKID.
**	26-jul-1993 (rogerk)
**	  - Change generation of Before Image log records during Online Backup.
**	    Instead of calling before_image_check on every dm0p_fixpage 
**	    operation, we now expect the modifier of the page to call 
**	    dm0p_before_image_check before changing its contents.
**	    Made before_image_check external and added dm0p_ prefix.
**	  - Fix dbg_dm9301 routine to not try to test the TCB cache lock if
**	    sole_server mode.  In this case there are no cache locks.
**	30-jul-1993 (shailaja)
**	    Fixed warnings generated by nested comments.
**	23-aug-1993 (andys)
**	    Fix bracketing logic in dm0p_reclaim such that it has a chance
**	    of working. 
**	    Don't use DB_FAIL_MACRO in [g]fault_page calls to dm0p_reclaim
**	    so that we know when we really can't get any more locks.
**	    In gfault_page, if dm0p_reclaim succeeds such that we retry,
**	    decrement the counter so that we retry the buffer we failed on.
**	23-aug-1993 (rachael)
**	    Fix dm0p_force_pages to restart at the beginning of the
**	    transaction list when force_page returns a status of E_DB_WARN
**      13-sep-93 (smc)
**          Commented lint pointer truncation warning, removed truncating cast
**          of page in call to ule_format.
**	20-sep-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Restore accidentally-commented-out code in dm0p_uncache_fix.
**	20-sep-1993 (andys)
**	    Fix arguments to ule_format call.
**	20-sep-1993 (jnash)
**	    Add flag param to LGreserve() calls.
**	18-oct-1993 (rachael) merged 23-mar-1993 (bryanp) -- B47950,B50252
**	    Fix handling of LK_VAL_NOTVALID from LKrequest. Anytime that you
**	    make a lock request call and ask for the value associated with the
**	    lock, LKrequest() may return the special warning code
**	    LK_VAL_NOTVALID. This means that the lock value was marked invalid
**	    by the locking system and cannot be trusted. Typically, this
**	    situation can be handled the same way as the "lock value has
**	    changed" situation is handled: discard the cached object because it
**	    isn't known to be correct. The value-not-value situation will
**	    persist until a new value is assigned to the resource, and we ensure
**	    that this new value is greater than the previous value, thus causing
**	    any other processes which have this object cached to discard their
**	    cached objects as well.
**	18-oct-1993 (rmuth)
**	    Initialise buffer Manager mananged objects.
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Changed Consistency Points to not start up write-behind threads to
**	    assist in flushing the cache to keep cache contention down
**	    during CP events.
**	    Fixed prototype errors.
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Changed the mlimit enforcing code in dm0p_uncache_fix and the
**	    flimit enforcing code in fault_page to select pages off of the 
**	    start of the modify priority queues rather than the end of the 
**	    queues to choose the least-recently-used pages as force victims.
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Added check for mlimit/flimit during LOGFULL conditions to
**	    dm0p_uncache_fix to reduce the number of log forces executed
**	    during recovery processing.
**	    Added dm0p_check_logfull routine.
**	22-nov-1993 (jnash)
**	    Add DM304 to dump locking info upon page or table escalation
**	    deadlocks, or unconditionally if RCP.  
**	24-jan-1994 (gmanning)
**	    Give name to semaphores that are created as CS_SEM_MULTI in order 
**	    to take advantage of cross process semaphores on NT.
**	11-oct-93 (johnst)
**	    Bug #56449
**	    Changed TRdisplay format args from %x to %p where necessary to
**	    display pointer types. We need to distinguish this on, eg 64-bit
**	    platforms, where sizeof(PTR) > sizeof(int).
**	09-nov-93 (swm)
**	    Bug #58633
**	    Corrected memory_needed alignment calculations for buffer manager
**	    memory, in dm0p_allocate(), to be consistent with subsequent
**	    pointer setup to the memory. Corrected buffer manager dbcache
**	    pointer setup.
**	22-feb-1994 (andys)
**	    Integrate recent changes from ingres63p.
**	    This should fix 1.0 bug 59308, as well as 6.4 bugs 46951,
**	    55150 and 54128.
**	    Update to use BUF_MUTEX_OK bit instead of the FCBUSY bit to
**	    indicate that the buffer is mutexed while not fixed.  The FCBUSY
**	    bit now only indicates to the CP threads that another CP thread
**	    is handling that buffer.
**	23-feb-1994 (andys)
**	    Clean up code inside xDEBUG which had not been updated for 1.0
**      14-mar-94 (stephenb)
**          Add new parameter to dma_write_audit() to match current prototype.
**	18-apr-1994 (jnash)
**	    fsync project.  Eliminate dm2f_force_file() calls.
**      17-May-1994 (daveb) 59127
**          Fixed semaphore leaks, named sems correctly.  Delete
**  	    redundant CSn_semaphore call.
**      23-may-1994 (andyw)
**          Should report CSp_semaphore() failure in dm0p_mlock. Bug 58606
**	23-may-1994 (andys)
**	    Add new parameter to dm0p_log_error which says whether to print

**          Bug #66815: Imported 6.4 change - Suppress error message reporting 
**          when a page is trying to be forced to a temorary file past EOF when
**          write-behind threads exist.        
**      04-apr-1995 (dilma04) 
**          Add support for rcb_k_duration == RCB_K_CURSOR_STABILITY and
**          rcb_k_duration == RCB_K_REPEATABLE_READ.
**	19-apr-1995 (cohmi01)
**	    Various performance changes related to the ManManX research:
**	    gfault_page() -If no free groups are found, besides writing out a
**	    modified group, signal the write-behind threads so that other
**	    ones will be written out, now that write-behinds handle groups.
**	    dm0p_flush_pages() - Add support for group buffers to write-behind 
**	    thread. Manage thresholds differently if in batch mode.
**	    dm0p_fix_page() - Always use READAHEAD when running in 'batch mode'.
**	24-apr-1995 (cohmi01)
**	    For new IOMASTER server write-along thread: add dm0p_write_along(),
**	    dm0p_no_lg_force(). Modify fix_tableio_ptr() to build new TBIO
**	    if DM0P_TBIO_BUILD specified.
**	05-may-1995 (cohmi01)
**		Obtain 'batch' status from dmf_svcb rather than bmcb.

**	26-jun-1995 (cohmi01)
**	    Provide for priority escalation of pages read by readahead thread
**	    so that if Pri queues become imbalanced with index/root pages,
**	    the user thread still gets the benefit of a leaf having been read.
**	    Fix old bug in fault_page where victims from free queue were
**	    being taken from most recently used pages instead of LRU.
**	27-jun-1995 (cohmi01)
**	    Use bitwise & instead of == for DM0P_FORCE test in dm0p_uncache_fix.
**	17-jul-1995 (cohmi01)
**	    Backout lewda02 DM0P_LOCKREAD change - causes page locks
**	    when not needed - eg when entire table is already locked,
**	    and thwarts the intent of other rcb flags related to locking.
**	    For Readahead thread - check for interrupt in dm0p_fix_page
**	    so that cancelled/stale requests incur no extra IO.
**      27-july-1995 (carly01)
**	    b69767 - set buffer priority and type for "in memory" tables.
**	18-sep-1995 (nick)
**	    Resolve clash of tracepoints - move checksum tracepoints to

**	    so rename to DM434.
**	24-oct-1995 (thaju02/stoli02)
**	    Added buffer manager single and group sync write counters.
**      9-feb-1996 (nick)
**          Fix EOF sensing error handling - we'd set err_code but
**          not status hence causing subsequent code to still run - the
**          correct thing to do is to error if we are past EOF and the new
**          page does not belongs to a temporary table.
**      08-feb-1996 (stial01)
**          dm0p_flush_pages() Don't look at bm_gmcount unless the buffer 
**          mutex is held, OR expect that the group modify queue may be
**          empty by the time you get the mutex.  
**          We saw a non zero bm_gmcount, got the mutex, by which time the
**          group modify queue was empty and we called gforce_page with
**          an uninitialized value for DM0P_GROUP *g. This resulted in a SEGV
**          in gforce_page(). Note sometimes the session would be hung
**          waiting on LOGIO.
**	25-mar-96 (nick)
**	    Various changes to fix the 'JPM' bug. #71597
**	30-may-1996 (pchang)
**	    Added support for DM0P_NOESCALATE action in dm0p_fix_page(), to be 
**	    used by sessions already holding an X lock on the FHDR when fixing 
**	    pages other an FMAP (i.e. without the DM0P_NOLOCK action).  Lock 
**	    escalation under such condition may lead to unrecoverable deadlock
**	    involving the table-level lock and the FHDR. (B76463) 
**	    Also, changed to display the E_DM9041_LK_ESCALATE_TABLE message 
**	    only prior to actual lock escalation.
**      06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Multiple buffer pools in support of variable page sizes.
**          Add page_size argument where necessary
**          Reserve correct space in log
**          Pass page_size argument to dm0l_bi
**          Pass page_size to dm2f_write_file(), dm2f_read_file()
**      17-apr-1996 (stial01)
**          Fixed incorrect reference to rpages

**	 4-jul-96 (pchang)
**	    More lock escalation stuff. #76463
**	17-jul-96 (nick)
**	    Use E_DM9063_LK_TABLE_MAXLOCKS instead of 
**	    E_DM9041_LK_ESCALATE_TABLE when we exceed the RCB lk limit.
**	29-aug-96 (nick)
**	    Only print E_DM9063_LK_TABLE_MAXLOCKS for user relations.
**      12-dec-1996 (cohmi01)
**          Add more info to lock timeout/deadlock msgs (Bug 79763).
**      01-aug-1996 (nanpr01 for ICL phil.p)
**          Introduce support for the Distributed Multi-Cache Management    
**          (DMCM) protocol.
**          DMCM is effectively Fast-Commit in a Multi-Cache environment.
**          All (but system catalog) pages retained in cache at the end
**          of transaction. Dirty pages retain their original lock, others
**          have the lock dropped to null.
**          Added dm0p_dmcm_callback, the function called when locking
**          contentions occur, after a lock request is made via
**          LKrequestWithCallback.
**          Added dmcm_cache_flush, called by a server running DMCM to
**          flush the cache of pages it last locked.
**          In dm0p_cachefix_page, fault_page, gfault_page and validate_page
**          calls to LKrequest have been replaced with calls to
**          LKrequestWithCallback (supplying dm0p_dmcm_callback as the
**          callback function).
**          dm0p_deallocate calls dmcm_cache_flush to empty the cache of
**          buffers locked by the current server before deallocating the
**          servers cache on server shutdown.
**          force_page modified to support an extra mode FP_NULL, used to
**          cause pages to be retained in cache with a null lock.
**          Integrate ICL gather write and DMCM with VPS:
**            Fix DM0P_BIO_EVENT, DM0P_FWAIT_EVENT, DM0P_PGMUTEX_EVENT 
**            Fixed declarations/initialization of bm_common, bm, cache_ix..
**            Added loop through all caches where necessary
**	24-Oct-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Semaphore granularity project. Many new semaphores replace
**	    lone bmcb_mutex.
**	07-Nov-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    In gforce_page(), if group is busy, do nothing but return E_DB_WARN.
**      22-nov-96 (dilma04, stial01)
**          Row Locking Project:
**          dm0p_page_lock_mode(), dm0p_latch_page() Created;
**          dm0p_fix_page() Latch page when row locking;
**          dm0p_unfix_page() Unlatch page when row locking;
**          dm0p_lock_page() Support for LK_PH_PAGE lock requests;
**          dm0p_unlock_page() Support for LK_PH_PAGE lock requests;
**          dm0p_escalate() Release all row, value and LK_PH_PAGE locks;
**          dm0p_trans_page_lock() added *tcb argument, replaced access_mode
                with lock_mode.
**	22-Nov-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    In gforce_page(), when waiting for a busy buffer, make sure that
**	    all buffers in the group have their mutexes released.
**      12-dec-96 (dilma04)
**          In dm0p_page_lock_mode: remove unneeded check for base table;
**          add dmd_check for debugging purposes.
**	12-Dec-96 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed dm0p_match() and code which MO attached to shared buffer
**	    manager mutexes.
**      06-jan-97 (dilma04)
**          Fix few row locking problems:
**          - request to release row locking specific locks in dm0p_escalate()
**          should be made unconditionally even if locking granularity of a 
**          cursor causing escalation is page level (bug 79817);  
**          - in dm0p_unfix_page() take out the optimization to release an
**          intent page lock if no qualifying records are found on the page;
**          - to prevent bug 79611 situation because of previous change, 
**          in dm0p_trans_page_lock() acquire a physical IX lock on a page
**          if row locking and DM0P_NOESCALATE flag is set;
**	10-jan-1997 (nanpr01)
**	    Put back the space holder for DM0L_BI, DM0L_AI.
**	05-Feb-1997(jenjo02)
**	    Defined new event wait, DM0P_GWAIT_EVENT. In gforce_page(),  
**	    if the group is busy, wait for it to become unbusy instead
**	    of just returning with a warning.
**      12-feb-97 (dilma04)
**          Set Lockmode Cleanup:
**          - test rcb_iso_level for isolation level; 
**          - use macro to check for serializable transaction.
**	12-Feb-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed bm_eq and references to it. This "empty queue" of buffers
**	    serves no purpose and may be an artifact pre-dating the 
**	    free priority queue 0.
**	    When waiting for or signalling DM0P_FWAIT_EVENT, protect 
**	    bm_status with its mutex.
**	    A bunch of changes to how and when modified pages are forced;
**	    don't force pages which might induce a log force if it can be
**	    avoided, ensure that free, modified, and fixed queues are
**	    properly aged, use SHARE mutex when scanning free/modified 
**	    queues.
**	    Reinstated lbm_lxid_mutex, used in those cases in which an lx_id
**	    isn't passed to this function to single-thread the use of 
**	    the BM's default lx_id.
**	24-Feb-1997(jenjo02 for somsa01)
**	    Cross-integrated 428939.
**	    Added tbio_extended to checking of Buffer Manager Force Protocols
**	    on core catalogs in fault_page(), gfault_page(), and
**	    dm0p_pagetype().
**	26-feb-1997 (dilma04)
**	    Change dm0p_trans_page_lock, dm0p_unfix_page() and dm0p_escalate()
**	    to support lock escalation for row locking and lower isolation
**	    levels.
**	24-Mar-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Table priority project:
**	  - Cache priority may now be set when table/index is created or modified.
**	  - Removed trace point DM425, dm0p_stbl_priority(), dm0p_gtbl_priority(),
**	    bmcb_tblpsize, bmcb_tblpindex, lbm_tblpriority.
**	  - Replaced BMCB_MAX_PRI with more widely-known DB_MAX_TABLEPRI.
**	  - Added new stats for fixed priority buffers.
**	  - Moved increment of bs_force into complete_f_p() so it can be consistently
**	    maintained.
**	  - A host of repairs to group buffer concurrency and DMCM problems.
**	  - Maintain buffer cache lock mode (buf_lock_mode) for all buffers, 
**	    not just DMCM.
**	  - Removed buf_pid, which is meaningless in a private cache.
**	01-May-1997 (jenjo02)
**	  - If group buffer's group is busy being faulted or forced, wait
**	    for the group, then retry (dm0p_cachefix_page()).
**	    Added new stat for number of group waits.
**	  - dm0p_cp_flush():
**	    - Rather than waiting for a BUSY or MUTEXed buffer, mark that spot
**	      and go on to find useful work. Iteratively return to those buffers
**	      until all skipped buffers have been processed for this CP.
**	    - Force only those pages which must be included in this CP.
**	      Previously, all modified buffers encountered were written, even
**	      those which were modified after the CP's LSN was established, 
**            causing the CP thread to act as a write-behind thread and 
**            extending the time needed to take the CP.
**	  - Let fixed priority buffers be flushed - after all, they'll just
**	    be written, not tossed (dm0p_flush_pages()).
**	06-May-1997 (jenjo02)
**	  - When checking the page modified bit (dm0p_close_page()), use the page size
**	    in the buffer, not the one from the tbio. The TCB at
**	    this point is that of the base table; if an index is
**	    of a different page size, this tbio won't work!
**	  - Rescinded LSN check outlined above. It's possible for a page to
**	    be modified (LSN1 ), have this CP start (CP LSN), and have the
**	    page be modified again (LSN2). If LSN2 > CP LSN, the page won't
**	    get written.
**      07-may-97 (dilma04)
**          Bug 81895. In dm0p_lock_page(), if LK returns LK_COV_LOCK, treat 
**          this lock as a new one.
**	08-May-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed resetting of BUF_LOCKED | BUF_CACHED when unlocking a page.
**	    This wasn't needed and was being done without the protection of
**	    the buffer's mutex (complete_f_p()).
**      14-may-97 (dilma04)
**          Cursor Stability Project:
**          - implemented page lock coupling for CS and RR isolation levels;
**          - added lock_id argument to dm0p_lock_page(), dm0p_unlock_page
**          and dm0p_trans_page_lock;
**          - added support for releasing locks by lock id and for releasing
**          exclusive locks.
**	19-May-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    In complete_f_p(), put empty pages at the head of the free queue
**	    so that fault_page() will pick them before valid pages, which are
**	    placed at the end of the free queue.
**      21-may-1997 (stial01)
**          Row locking: Replace LK_PH_PAGE locks with lock on buffer
**          dm0p_fix_page: Remove request for LK_PH_PAGE lock
**          dm0p_unfix_page: Remove release of LK_PH_PAGE locks
**          dm0p_cachefix_page(), fault_page(), gfault_page():
**            - Buffer may be fixed for write by multiple transactions:
**              Do not put buf with IX page lock on xn queue
**            - Removed code for non-fast-commit when row locking (not allowed) 
**            - Removed code for BUF_PAWRITE when IX lock. Pass abort of
**              row locking transactions is not permitted since there is no way
**              to coordinate page access between the dbms server and the

**          dm0p_uncache_fix: Crash server if refcount is 0 and buffer is locked
**          dm0p_escalate: Remove release of LK_PH_PAGE locks

**      29-may-1997 (stial01)
**          Rename DM0P_IX_LOCK -> DM0P_INTENT_LK, BUF_IX_LOCK -> BUF_INTENT_LK
**          dm0p_fix_page: If IS/IX/SIX page lock, action |= DM0P_INTENT_LK
**        - dm0p_uncache_fix: Added additional consistency checks if row locking
**          dm0p_unmutex: zero out buf_lock_id when buffer is unlocked
**      13-jun-97 (dilma04)
**          Repeatable Read optimization in dm0p_unfix_page(): set flag to

**      28-Jul-97 (merja01)
**         move preprocessor stmts to col 1 to fix compile errors on axp_osf.
**	31-jul-97 (muhpa01)
**	    Removed the pragma for level 2 optimization for hp8_us5 - level 2
**	    is now the default.  Added NO_OPTIM for hp8_us5 - this cures a
**	    SIGBUS error in dm0p_allocate().
**	21-Aug-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    In dm0p_flush_pages(), lock buffer before locking group to adhere
**	    to mutex protocol and avoid deadlocks.
**	25-Aug-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Added log_id (LG_LXID) parameter to dm0p_close_page(), dm0p_toss_pages(),
**	    dm0p_wpass_abort(), dm0p_tblcache(), complete_toss_pages(), unfix_tableio_ptr(),
**	    fix_tableio_ptr(), complete_wpass_abort() so that it can be passed into
**	    force_page() and ease the burden on the buffer manager's default log_id,
**	    lbm_lxid.
**	28-Aug-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Well, the 21-Aug change didn't work all that well. Redid group-busy logic,
**	    in general, lock group, set busy status, unlock group, then lock buffer.
**	    Functions affected: gforce_page(), gfault_page(), dm0p_force_pages(),
**	    dm0p_flush_pages(), dm0p_write_along().
**      28-aug-97 (musro02)
**         Added nooptim for sqs_ptx to avoid undefined symbol .BKdp0
**	03-Sep-1997 (jenjo02)
**	  o Cross-integration of 427407. page_number in dm0p_1toss_page(),

**	29-Sep-1997 (merja01)
**		Remove left over their>> from a prior integration.
**	29-aug-1997 (bobmart)
**	    Allow user to configure the types of lock escalations to be

**        Change comment character on horda03's last "ifdef VMS" integ.
**      12-nov-97 (stial01)
**          Pass lockKEY even if unlocking with lockID (for set lock_trace)
**          Consolidated rcb fields into rcb_csrr_flags.
**	19-Nov-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    complete_f_p() was releasing buffer's buf_mutex before returning with an
**	    I/O error, causing dmd_checks() when the force_page() caller then tried
**	    to release the same mutex.
**	10-Dec-1997 (jenjo02)
**	  o In functions which are apt to force more than one page, keep the TBIO
**	    instead of always releasing it; if the next page to be forced is for the
**	    same table, reuse the TBIO - if not, unfix the TBIO and fix another
**	    one. Functions affected: dm0p_force_pages(), dm0p_cp_flush(), 
**	    dm0p_flush_pages(), dm0p_toss_pages(), dm0p_wpass_abort(), dm0p_write_along().
**	  o Rewrote code which scans modified and fixed priority queues such that it
**	    can do so without taking a _queue mutex, eliminating the bulk of contention
**	    between write-behind threads and fault_page()/gfault_page().
**	  o Eliminated the single buffer (bm_fq) and group (bm_gfq) fixed state queues.
**	    These queues were never read and served no real purpose other than 
**	    contentious resources. Two queues remain, the free and modified. Buffers
**	    which are fixed or fixed and modified, appear on no state queue.
**	19-Jan-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Renamed fields associated with transactions queues to make them more
**	    generally useful. Added bmcb_tabq_buckets, a hash table which 
**	    cross-cache links BUF_VALID pages belonging to a table. This hash 
**	    is used in functions which previously sequentially searched
**	    all caches to find pages associated with a table: dm0p_close_page(),
**	    dm0p_reparent_pages(), dm0p_toss_pages(), dm0p_dmcm_callback(), and
**	    dm0p_count_pages(). In large cache configurations, this was a 
**	    prohibitively expensive operation.
**	29-Jan-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Refined table cache queue search techniques to avoid taking mutexes
**	    where possible.
**  26-Feb-1998 (bonro01)
**      Added cleanup code for cross-process semaphores during
**      MEsmdestroy().
**	24-Mar-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    When computing table hash queue bucket, cast table_id to (u_i4).
**	    Using i4 causes DG (at least) to come up with the wrong
**	    bucket and leads to (at least) incomplete CP errors!
**	20-May-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Rewrote WriteBehind facility. WriteBehind threads are now cache-specific,
**	    dynamic, and demand-driven.
**	    Added cache_ix to BMCB and TBIO to avoid recomputing it all the time
**	    from page size.
**	    Set BUF_TEMPTABLE status in temptable buffers so that CP flush can detect
**	    them without the need of a TBIO.
**	01-Jun-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    In dm0p_start_wb_threads(), check for LBMCB; if STAR server, there won't be one.
**	10-Jun-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Callers of gforce_page() are solely responsible for awakening group waiters.
**	11-Jun-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Added flags parm to dm0p_ewait() in which to pass LK_E_INTERRUPT,
**	    used by DM0P_WBFLUSH_EVENTs.
**	    Changed event type to be a composite of DM0P_WBFLUSH_EVENT and the cache_ix
**	    being serviced by the thread so lockstat can display it.
**	23-Jun-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Added LK_VALUE parm to dm0p_unlock_page(), dm0p_lock_page() prototypes.
**	    Don't assume a buffer is on transaction queue just because 
**	    page is fixed for write, but check explicitly. Remove buffer
**	    from txn queue when unfixed.
**	    In fault_page(), moved release of buf_mutex til after all buf_sts bits
**	    have been decided on and set.
**	    Tidied up use of DMPP_GET_PAGE_STAT macros.
**	20-Jul-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Jumbo cache changes:
**	    LKevent() event type and value enlarged and changed from 
**	    u_i4's to *LK_EVENT structure to support more than 65536 total
**	    buffers.
**	    When row locking, newly allocated pages (DM0P_CREATE | DM0P_CREATE_COND)
**	    are now fixed LK_X, not LK_IX, and converted down to LK_IX by dm1p.c to
**	    close a concurrency window whereby multiple threads could be fixing and
**	    formatting the same page at the same time.
**	    In dm0p_cp_flush(), if the modified and fixed buffer counts are, or are 
**	    reduced to, zero, skip the remainder of the cache - there are no buffers 
**	    which need flushing.
**	19-Aug-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    In dm0p_fix_page(), return lock id into rcb_fix_lkid.
**	01-Sep-1998 (jenjo02)
**	  o Renamed DM0P_CREATE_COND flag to DM0P_CREATE_NOFMT to identify its
**	    new interpretation. When passed from dm1p (scan_map), the newly allocated
**	    page will be fixed into the cache, but will be mutexed instead of formatted; 
**	    dm1p will instead do the formatting. This fixes concurrency problems in which
**	    multiple threads fixed and eventually (re-)formatted the same page. 
**	    scan_map will retest the "free page" bit before committing to formatting
**	    the page.
**	  o Moved BUF_MUTEX waits out of bmcb_mwait, lbm_mwait, into DM0P_BSTAT where
**	    mutex waits by cache can be accounted for.
**	01-oct-1998 (somsa01)
**	    In complete_f_p(), in case of E_DM9448_DM2F_NO_DISK_SPACE
**	    and tbio_temporary, invalidate the page and return an OK
**	    status. Also, pass in log_id to complete_f_p().  (Bug #93633)
**	08-oct-1998 (somsa01)
**	    In complete_f_p(), corrected last cross-integration; cache_ix
**	    is now bm->bm_cache_ix. Also, invalidate_page() now takes four
**	    parameters.
**	22-Oct-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Repaired some static declarations the HP compiler complained about.
**	29-Oct-1998 (jenjo02)
**	  o Added new action, DM0P_PHYSICAL_IX, which induces a physical IX
**	    lock when row locking instead of a physical X (dm0p_page_lock_mode()).
**	  o Lock requests for PHYSICAL locks made non-interruptable.
**	  o When running with Ingres, not OS threads, don't do dirty, unmutexed
**	    list scans. This can induce long-lasting loops because the looping
**	    thread fails to yield to other threads to alter the condition
**	    of the objects on the list.
**	03-Dec-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed test for, and skipping of, fixed priority buffers when
**	    scanning the modified and free queues in fault_page(). 
**	    It ate CPUs and was really of no benefit.
**      15-dec-1998 (kitch01)
**	    Bug 94536. Added err_code for passing to ule_format instead of
**	    error.
**	    In functions complete_toss_pages() and complete_wpass_abort().
**	22-Dec-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Align start of page buffers on DI_RAWIO_ALIGN for raw database
**	    locations.
**	15-jan-1999 (nanpr01)
**	    Pass pointer to pointer to appropriate function.
**	19-jan-1999 (muhpa01)
**	    Removed NO_OPTIM for hp8_us5.
**	21-Jan-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    In fault_page(), read the page if DM0P_CREATE_NOFMT and the page
**	    to be read is within the bounds of formatted pages for the table
**	    (page is being reused).
**	29-jan-1999 (hayke02 for stial01, jenjo02)
**	    Check for BUF_FIXED when scanning the modified queue for buffers
**	    to write when (i) below the free buffer limit in fault_page(),
**	    (ii) the modify limit has been reached in dm0p_uncache_fix() and
**	    (iii) when flushing modified pages from the buffer cache in
**	    dm0p_flush_pages(). This prevents E_DM934D and E_DM930C errors.
**	    This change fixes bug 94855.
**	01-Feb-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    In dm0p_pagetype(), determine buf_type unconditionally, not just 
**	    for temp tables. Added consistency check to ensure that the right 
**	    page is mapped and that it's fixed.
**      13-feb-1999 (nanpr01)
**          Support update mode lock.
**      22-Feb-1999 (bonro01)
**          Replace references to svcb_log_id with
**          dmf_svcb->svcb_lctx_ptr->lctx_lgid
**      08-Mar-1999 (wanya01)
**          dm0p_cachefix_page() Bug 91094. If the group is not busy, we 
**          make it busy, and we make it free until finishing move_group. This
**          prevent another thread from taking the same group from the free
**          queue. 
**      28-apr-1999 (hanch04)
**          Replaced STlcopy with STncpy
**      16-Apr-1999 (hanal04)
**          Prevent incorrect err_code (LK_NOLOCKS) being returned from
**          dm0p_trans_page_lock() when lock escalation error logging
**          has been disabled. b96165.
**	06-May-1999 (jenjo02)
**	  o Redesigned CP buffer picking mechanism. When a CP is signalled, the
**	    caches are quickly dirty-scanned for "candidate" pages (modified or 
**	    fixed for write and dirty, no temptable pages) and placed on an 
**	    installation-wide CP queue. The CP threads then operate only on 
**	    this working-set of buffers. Buffers which were fixed but not
**	    modified prior to the start of the CP need not be processed, but
**	    would have been using the replaced cache-bashing algorithm.
**	    New static functions cp_prep() and cp_flush().
**	  o Replaced buffer's buf_index with a DM0P_BID structure, buf_id,
**	    which contains both the buffer's index and its cache index. Thus
**	    the cache can easily be found given only a buffer, and it's no
**	    longer necessary to also pass a pointer to the buffer's DM0P_BMCB 
**	    (*bm) when the buffer is known.
**	  o Added buf_page_offset (offset to page within cache) so that it
**	    doesn't have to be constantly computed.
**	29-Jun-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Implemented GatherWrite for cache-flushing operations.
**	12-Jul-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Replaced CP candidate buffer list with array of buffer identifiers.
**	    Once extracted, the array is sorted into (dbid,table_id,index_id,page)
**	    order, then fed to cp_flush().
**	16-aug-1999 (nanpr01)
**	    Implementation of SIR 92299. Enabaling journalling on a
**	    online checkpoint. Turn on cache locking for iirelation catalog.
**	24-Aug-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Added 2 new buf_type values, BMCB_FHDR and BMCB_FMAP, previously
**	    identified as "BMCB_ROOT" types. Added stats by buf_type to aid
**	    in analyzing cache LRU behavour. Bump buf_priority each time
**	    a page is found in cache, whether currently fixed or not, instead
**	    of only when not currently fixed. Added sth_count to state queue
**	    header structure to track number of elements on a state queue.
**	    When reclaiming a buffer for reuse (fault_page()), mark it as
**	    BUF_RECLAIM, signalling force_page() to remove it from whatever
**	    queue it's on but not insert it on to the free queue.
**	09-Sep-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Check breach of RCB lock limit only if a new lock was acquired
**	    to avoid bogus lock escalations and secondary escalate deadlock 
**	    during transaction abort.
**	14-Sep-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    24-Aug-1999 change sent free buffer counts (bm_fcount) wildly out 
**	    of control, effectively shutting down the WriteBehind mechanism.
**      20-sep-1999 (stial01)
**          dm0p_unfix_page() Convert lock on dirty etab leaf pages (2k page)
**	11-Oct-1999 (jenjo02)
**	  o cachefix_page(): No need to wait for write-busy buffer if it's 
**	    being written by a CP or WB thread; it'll still be valid after
**	    the write completes.
**	  o fault_page(): ifdef'd out clock aging and its contentious mutexing.
**	    More mods to free page selection.
**	  o Test locally for security before wasting a call to dma_write_audit().
**	  o Added 2 new external functions, dm0p_lock_buf/dm0p_unlock_buf, to
**	    set and release a BUF_MLOCK on a page without excessive mutexing
**	    of the buffer's buf_mutex.
**	  o cp_flush(): Only set BUF_MUTEX on BUF_FIXED pages to prevent 
**	    unnecessary mutex waits.
**	  o cp_flush()/dm0p_flush_pages(): If synch writes occur, abandon use
**	    of GatherWrite to minimize the time the buffers are in a BUF_BUSY
**	    state and unavailable to other threads.
**	27-Oct-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    When tossing a page from the cache, invalidate its page number by
**	    setting it to -1. This keeps external viewers, for example dm1p, 
**	    from viewing the page in an inconsistent state.
**      12-nov-1999 (stial01)
**          Changes to how btree key info is stored in tcb
**	30-Nov-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Added DB_DIS_TRAN_ID parm to LKcreate_list() prototype.
**	15-Dec-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed DB_DIS_TRAN_ID parm from LKcreate_list() prototype.
**	    Added DB_DIS_TRAN_ID parm to LGbegin() prototype.
**	10-Jan-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Implemented group priority queues, modified WriteBehind code
**	    to reduce thrashing on low-priority modified queues.
**	    When faulting in temptable pages, reduce their resultant
**	    buffer priority by one to cause them to age sooner than
**	    non-temptable pages.
**	    Removed static page state queue counts (bm_fcount, bm_mcount,
**	    bm_lcount, etc) and contentious bm_count_mutex. New macros
**	    (DM0P_COUNT_?) now tally the counts when they are of interest.
**	    Inlined CSp|v_semaphore calls. dm0p_mlock|munlock are now 
**	    macros which call dm0p_mlock_fcn()|dm0p_munlock_fcn()
**	    iff the semaphore request fails.
**	09-Mar-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    In dm0p_cp_flush(), unfix any TBIO left around before waiting
**	    for a BUF_MUTEXed page to avoid undetectable deadlock.
**	13-Apr-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Corrected loop in gfault_page() caused by earlier failed
**	    gfault_page() and mishandling of g_valcount.
**	20-Apr-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Spread cache allocations across multiple segments if 
**	    segment overflow occurs. Allocate CP array per cache instead
**	    of cross-cache, induce WriteBehind participation in CP flush.
**	    Moved defines of CACHENAME_SUFFIX, CACHENM_MAX to dm0pbmcb.h
**	    for exposure in cacheutil.c, which til now had the values
**	    hard-coded.
**      22-May-2000 (islsa01)
**          Declare this function dm0p_check_logfull to EXTERN instead of
**          local to this file. (B90402)
**	23-May-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    CP flush failures reported if cp_array's pages' TCBs have
**	    all been purged by the time the CP thread sees them. This
**	    is ok as long as the pages have been stamped processed
**	    for the CP and should be tolerated.
**	14-Jun-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Simplified and streamlined interface to gforce_page().
**	    In move_group(), must wait for busy group before modifying 
**	    its attributes and/or changing its queue.
**	23-Jun-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Added fill_option to dmpp_format() prototype, set by caller
**	    to DM1C_ZERO_FILL if dmpp_format should MEfill the page,
**	    DM1C_ZERO_FILLED if the page has already been MEfilled.
**	    The page overhead space is always zero-filled.
**      06-jul-2000 (stial01)
**          Changes to btree leaf/index klen in tcb (b102026)
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	24-Feb-2000 (devjo01)
**	    Corrected parameters to ule_format calls for E_DMA00D and
**          E_DM004B.  (b100589).
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	08-Aug-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Remove test for WriteBehind in gfault_page(), which was
**	    causing group reads to be abandoned when they should not
**	    have been. (B102294)
**      31-aug-2000 (stial01 for jenjo02)
**          ignore E_DM0054 for indexes (B83999)
**	08-Sep-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Rewrote checksum algorithm to use first and last 16 bytes
**	    of page instead of entire page. This makes the cost of
**	    computing a checksum static rather than logarithmic.
**	    Old algorithm retained for read-compatibility with 
**	    existing databases.
**	22-Sep-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Added g_lock_list to DM0P_GROUP, lock list of thread that
**	    set G_BUSY state. move_group() won't wait for busy group
**	    if the lock list matches.
**	11-Oct-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Fix endless loop in fault_page() if neither a free nor
**	    modified page can be found to force.
**      23-oct-2000 (stial01)
**          Variable Page Size - Variable Page Type support (SIR 102955)
**	 6-feb-2001 (mosjo01)
**	    Removed sqs_ptx from NO_OPTIM (seems to work optimized).
**          Consolidated dr6_us5 and rs4_us5 into one NO_OPTIM.
**
**	    For sqs_ptx ONLY, I am bypassing gfault_page() for <Temporary
**	    Tables>. This avoids DirectRead errors randomly occuring in 
**	    cldio.c (DIread and IIdio_read) with II_DIRECT_IO in effect.
**	    Added xDEBUG TRdisplay traces under gfault_page().
**	9-mar-2001 (toumi01)
**	    If this is the last (or only) CP thread to process this cache,
**	    ensure that every buffer in the CP array has been processed.
**	    This situation could occur, for example, if an assisting
**	    WriteBehind thread (which does -not- maintain cpindex) has
**	    beaten us to the CP array, processed every buffer, and closed
**	    every TCB.
**      09-mar-2001 (stial01)
**          Changes for Variable Page Type SIR 102955
**	21-mar-2001 (devjo01)
**	    When using INTERNAL threads, server could hang if all group
**	    buffers had busy TCB's.  Fixed 'all_group_tcbs_busy' logic
**	    to avoid this (b104299).
**	09-Apr-2001 (jenjo02)
**	    Changed dm2f_write_list() prototype to include pointers
**	    to GatherWrite stats collectors.
**	21-May-2001 (jenjo02)
**	  o Collapsed all those specialized "complete_...()" GatherWrite
**	    I/O completion routines into just "complete_f_p()", which
**	    is now called for all write completion operations whether
**	    GatherWrite is enabled or not.
**	  o Added "awaken_buf_waiter()" to handle the resumption of 
**	    buffer I/O, Mutex, and FC waiters in a consistent fashion,
**	    reset the status, release buf_mutex, resume waiting threads,
**	    rather than prematurely resuming the thread then resetting
**	    status then releasing buf_mutex only to have the resumed
**	    thread potentially immediately colliding on buf_mutex.
**	  o Bump priority of fixed READNOLOCK buffers when found in cache
**	    the same as non-READNOLOCK buffers to keep them from getting
**	    tossed prematurely.
**	  o In cp_flush(), skip I/O-busy buffers instead of waiting
**	    for the I/O to complete as they can be considered processed
**	    for the current CP.
**	30-may-2001 (devjo01)
**	    Add lgclustr.h for LGcluster() macro. s103715.
**      12-Jun-2001 (horda03)
**          In the port for 1.2 to 2.0 something has been lost to the change
**          I made on 29-Aug-1997. But anyhow, things have moved on, and now
**          VMS has the missing fields within the CL_ERR_DESC structure.
**          The temporary VMS fix can now be removed, which fixes Bug 104932
**      02-Aug-2001 (stial01)
**          dm0p_unfix_page() fix etab LEAF page lock conversion (b105412)
**	16-aug-2001 (toumi01)
**	    NO_OPTIM for i64_aix because of SEGV doing "createdb -S iidbdb"
**	11-jun-2002 (devjo01)
**	    In gfault_page add more logic to prevent futile gfault attempts,
**	    especially when using internal threads. (b107914, b104299).
**	28-Feb-2002 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed LK_MULTITHREAD from LKrequest/release flags. 
**	    MULTITHREAD is now an attribute of lbm_lock_list and
**	    svcb_lock_list.
**	06-Jun-2002 (jenjo02)
**	    Check that bm_flimit (free buffer limit) does not exceed
**	    90% of cache; if so, silently reduce it to that value.
** 	    Test of flimit in fault_page() was reversed, counting
**	    free pages when WB threads were running instead of when
**	    they were not. 
**      12-jun-2002 (stial01)
**          dm0p_uncache_fix() Make sure we update cache lock value for all
**          special page types and tables that use physical page locks (b107946)
**      19-Jun-2002 (horda03) Bug 108074
**          Prevent FORCE_ABORT transaction filling TX log
**          file by not flushing SCONCUR pages unless we
**          really need to (i.e. the table isn't locked
**          exclusively).
**	16-Jul-2002 (jenjo02)
**	    Incomplete CP errors can occur in multiple server installations

**	    b109051.
**	15-Nov-2002 (jenjo02)
**	    Renamed "bm_wb_mutex" to "bm_mutex". Cleared up confusion 
**	    re protection of "bm_status" via -both- bmcb_status_mutex
**	    and bm_wb_mutex; now just "bm_mutex" does the job
**	    (BUG 109131).
**	13-jun-2002 (thaju02)
**	    For readlock nolock, specials page types (btree root/index, fhdr)
**	    that are fixed with the DM0P_LOCKREAD action, are to be locked

**	17-oct-2005 (devjo01) b114660
**	    - Under highly concurrent cirucumstances in a cluster, it is
**	    possible for a stale callback to see a BUF_RBUSY set by
**	    dm0p_validate.  This would stall the callback thread, and in
**	    the worst case cause a scheduling deadlock where the holder
**	    of the page cache lock on the other node could not release
**	    the fatal page (typically a map page) because a blocking
**	    notification to the stalled callback thread could not be
**	    processed.
**	    - Added LK_CALLBACK_TRACE instances to held debug above.
**	28-nov-2005 (devjo01) b115583
**	    Restore tracking of which process allocated buffer page cache
**	    locks to accomidate deficiencies in the VMS DLM.  Since under
**	    VMS, locks must be operated on by the process which allocated
**	    them, we MUST toss all pages covered by a lock allocated by
**	    a DBMS being shutdown.  Note, this also would apply to a crashing
**	    DBMS, but as all DBMS processes attached to a shared cache are
**	    already obliged to abend, if one of them should crash, this is
**	    moot.
**	30-nov-2005 (abbjo03)
**	    Remove globavalue SS$_DEBUG declaration which causes unexplained

**          If a table is being Materialized, then don't try and force any pages. This

**	21-May-2007 (kschendel) b122121
**	    There are DMF servers that share cache but don't contain a CP
**	    thread (e.g. fastload).  Add a CP thread count and revise CP
**	    stuff to use that instead of server count.  (Using the server
**	    count could cause the doing-CP bit in the bmcb to get stuck ON,
**	    causing broken CP's that do the log stuff but flush no buffers.)

/*{
** Name: dm0p_allocate	- Allocate and initialize the buffer manager.
**
** Description:
**
**	This routine allocates and initializes the Buffer Manager data
**	structures and control blocks.
**
**	There are two control blocks used by the Buffer Manager: 
**
**          BMSCB:  Buffer Manager Segment Control Block
**          LBMCB:  Local Buffer Manager Control Block
**
**      The BMSCB is the control block at the beginning of each segment 
**      of buffer manager memory. Note that multiple segments of memory
**      are allocated when the installation is configured with multiple
**      buffer caches that are to be allocated separately or if segment
**	overflow occurs. The BMSCB contains the offsets to interesting 
**	sections of buffer manager memory allocated contiguous with the BMSCB.
**
**      The LBMCB contains pointers to the buffer manager data arrays.    
**      Each server must keep its own set of pointers since the BMSCB(s)
**      may be positioned at a different address(es) in different servers.
**      In a shared buffer manager environment, the BMSCB(s) are shared
**      by multiple servers, while each server has its own LBMCB.
**
**	In addition to these control blocks, this routine allocates:
**            Buffer Manager common control block  
**            Database and Table cache arrays
**
**      The following are also allocated for EACH BUFFER POOL:
**            Buffer manager control block 
**            Buffer descriptors
**            Group descriptors
**            Hash buckets
**            Data Pages
**	      GatherWrite structures, if GW enabled
**	      Consistency Point array
**
**	When the Buffer Manager is positioned in shared memory, everything
**	but the LBMCB is allocated out of a shared memory segment(s).
**      The buffer manager contains lists of buffer descriptors.
**      These lists are formed by index values rather than pointers,
**      as no pointers may be stored in the shared memory data structures.
**      The first server to start up will create the shared segment(s)
**      and initialize the data structures. Subsequent servers will merely 
**      allocate an LBMCB and set up pointers to the shared data structures.
**  
**      The buffer cache contains multiple buffer pools. A separate buffer 
**      pool is maintained for each page size.  
**
**      The size of the Buffer Cache is determined mainly by the number of
**      pages allocated for each buffer pool. The buffer[pool] and group[pool] 
**      parameters specify the number of Ingres pages stored in that pool:
**
**        # pages[pool] = buffers[pool] + (group[pool] * gpages[pool]))
**
**	There is one buffer descriptor allocated for each Ingres page (even 
**	pages that are used in group operations). In addition, each set of pages
**	used for group operations has a group descriptor.  The buffer
**	descriptors take about 150 bytes each while the group ones require
**	about 50 bytes.  There is also a (small) hash bucket header for
**	finding pages in the cache;  one bucket per page, rounded up to
**	the next even number.
**
**      Also contributing to the size of the Buffer Manager (but less
**      significantly) are the database and table caches.
**	The number of database and table cache entries is given by the
**	'dbc_size' and 'tbc_size' parameters.  These specify the number of
**	databases/tables that can remain cached even while closed.  Each
**	cache entry requires about 70 bytes.
**
**      The 'group[pool]' parameter specifies the number of group buffers
**      to be allocated for that pool. The group buffers are used for 
**      multi-page I/O's - which are used for readahead. If 'group[pool]' 
**      is zero, no readahead will be performed for that pool.
**	The 'gpages[pool]' parameter gives the number of pages in each 
**      group operation for that pool. 
**
**      The 'free_limit[pool]' parameter specifies the number of buffers 
**      which must always be available on the free list for that pool.
**      (not fixed or modified). When this limit is reached, all new 
**      requests for buffers in that pool must toss a page off the modified  
**	list rather than use one from the free list.
**
**      The 'modify_limit[pool]' parameter specifies the maximum number
**      of pages that can be left in the cache for that pool. When this
**      limit is reached, all dirty pages in that pool are written as soon  
**      as they are unfixed.
**
**      The 'wb_start[pool]' and 'wb_end[pool]' parameters specify the 
**      window used for that pool by the write behind threads (if any are
**      allocated).  This is a window on the number of modified pages
**      in that pool.  When there are at least wb_start modified pages, 
**	the write behind threads begin to write modified pages from the pool, 
**	transferring them to the free queue. When the count goes below
**	wb_end, the writing stops.  The write behind threads are started up 
**	by SCF at server initialization.
**
**	The 'cache_name' parameter specifies the name of the buffer cache if
**	a shared memory buffer manager is specified.
**
**	Some of the Buffer Manager objects that are initialized here are:
**
**	  Buffer Manager Lock - If a shared memory buffer manager is
**			specified, a lock on the specified cache will be
**			requested.  This lock will tell us whether this server
**			is the first connector - in which case the memory
**			segment should be created and initialized, or if there
**			is already a server connected - in which case we should
**			just connect to that segment.  Holding this lock will
**			tell other servers that the buffer manager has been
**			initialized.
**
**	  Buffer Manager Lock List - This is the lock list on which all
**			cache locks are held.  It is a shared lock list that
**			can be referenced by all servers using this same buffer
**			manager.  The lock list is created by the server which
**			initializes the buffer manager - servers just
**			connecting to an already existing shared buffer manager
**			just attach to the lock list.
**
**	  Buffer Manager Id - The buffer manager id is a unique identifier for
**			this buffer manager.  It is set using the value of the
**			buffer manager lock list.
**
**	  Server count - The count of servers connected to this buffer manager
**			is incremented.
**
**	  Buffer Descriptors - Each single buffer descriptor is initialized
**			and put on the priority zero free list.
**			Each buffer descriptor for group buffers is
**			initialized but is not put on any list.
**
**	  Group Descriptors - Each group descriptor is initialized and put on
**			the group free queue.
**
**	  Modify/Fixed queues - The fixed and modify queues (single and group)
**			are initialized empty.
**
**	  Database cache array - The database cache array is initialized.  The
**			entries are linked together into one list with each
**			entry being marked free.
**
**	  Table cache array - The table cache array is initialized.  The
**			entries are linked together into one list with each
**			entry being marked free.
**

**
** History:
**	15-oct-1985 (derek)
**          Created new for Jupiter.
**	30-sep-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Added wb_start and wb_end parameters.  These specify asychronous
**	    write behind window.
**	30-jan-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for shared memory buffer manager.  Made buffer manager
**	    position independent and broke into BMCB/LBMCB.  Added database
**	    and table caches, BM lock, BM lock list, BM id and server count.
**	    Made buffer manager semaphore be cross-process semaphore.
**	    Added flags, tbc_size, dbc_size and cache_name parameters.
**	10-apr-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added bm_name field to hold buffer manager name.
**	    Fill in the control block header information when allocate
**	    a shared memory buffer manager.
**	15-may-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Changed to return resource errors rather than internal dm0p
**	    error if memory or lock resource limits reached.
**	    Updated MEget_pages call to reflect CL approved interface.
**	 7-jun-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added new error messages for more informative errors when allocating
**	    shared buffer manager.
**	19-jun-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Lower case the cache name.
**	 2-oct-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Changed to use normal semaphore rather than cross-process semaphore
**	    when not using shared buffer manager.  On some systems, cross
**	    process semaphores cannot be used on non-shared memory.
**	6-Oct-1989 (ac)
**	    Added DM0P_MASTER to create the buffer manager lock list as a
**	    master lock list.
**	1-Feb-1990 (ac)
**	    Added make the bm_lock_list noninterruptable so that the lock
**	    wait on the lock list will not be cancelled.
**      11-sep-1990 (jonb)  
**	    Integrated ingres6301 change 280136 (rogerk):
**            Initialize the buf_tcb_stamp field.
**	 4-feb-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for fixed buffer priorities.
**	    Added table priority cache to remember user-set table priorities.
**		(this is needed since table priorities are not currently
**		set in the system catalogs.)
**      16-dec-1991 (bryanp)
**          Add ME_IO_MASK to MEget_pages call for shared buffer cache. This
**          indicates to DI that it is advantageous for the slaves to map this
**          memory (that way, they can perform I/O directly w/o copying).
**	19-feb-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Fix error message formatting problem in dm0p_allocate(). We don't
**	    want to pass the sys_err to ule_format when dm0m_allocate fails
**	    because the sys_err doesn't have anything useful in it.
**	07-apr-1992 (jnash)
**	    Add support for locking a shared DMF cache in dm0p_allocate.
**	28-sep-92 (kwatts)
**	    Add call of CSn_semaphore to give name to the shared cache
**	    semaphore.
**	26-oct-92 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging Project:
**	      - Added buffer manager transaction context to be used by
**		force_page to force the log file before writing pages.
**	      - Added buffer manager semaphore to protect usage of the
**		above transaction context.
**	      - Took sys_err argument out of error msg calls when CSi_semaphore
**		returns an error since there is no sys_err value.
**	23-Oct-1992 (daveb)
**	    Attach shared semaphore for monitoring, and name the local
**	    cache semaphore too.  Note we aren't detaching the shared
**	    sem yet; not sure we need to or where the right place is.
**	26-apr-1993 (bryanp/keving)
**	    Added have_log argument. If this is set true then we have
**		previously allocated our local log. Otherwise logs will be 
**		allocated later and registered via dm0p_register_loghandles. 
**		Used by CSP to handle multi-logs case. 
**	18-oct-1993 (rmuth)
**	    Initialise buffer Manager mananged objects and add DMP_BMCB 
**	    statistics.
**	24-jan-1994 (gmanning)
**	    Give name to semaphores that are created as CS_SEM_MULTI in order 
**	    to take advantage of cross process semaphores on NT.
**	09-nov-93 (swm)
**	    Bug #58633
**	    Corrected memory_needed alignment calculations for buffer manager
**	    memory, in dm0p_allocate(), to be consistent with subsequent
**	    pointer setup to the memory. Corrected buffer manager dbcache
**	    pointer setup.
**      17-May-1994 (daveb) 59127
**          Fixed semaphore leaks, named sems correctly.  Delete
**  	    redundant CSn_semaphore call.
**	25-Apr-1995 (jenjo02)
**	    Combined CSi|n_semaphore functions calls into single
**	    CSw_semaphore call.
**	25-mar-96 (nick)
**	    Added lbm_fcwait initialisation.
**      06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Multiple buffer pools in support of variable page sizes.
**      01-aug-1996 (nanpr01 for ICL phil.p)
**          Create lbmcb->lbm_dmcm_lock_list for use by DMCM protocol.
**	    Added the gather write and async io amendments.
**      10-aug-1998(hweho01)
**          Semaphore "BM lx_id" is not defined in the shared memory, its 
**          type should be CS_SEM_SINGLE.
**	19-May-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Dynamic, per-cache  WriteBehind threads.
**	02-dec-1998 (nanpr01)
**	    Making sure mlock works for private cache as well.
**	12-Jul-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Allocate array of BIDs, one per buffer per cache, to be used
**	    to pre-sort the candidate Consistency Point buffers.
**	30-Aug-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Make the 2k cache an option, not a requirement.
**	20-Apr-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Monitor segment overflow; if it occurs, allocate cache
**	    in a new segment. Allocate CP array for each cache rather
** 	    than for all caches.
**	06-Jun-2002 (jenjo02)
**	    Check that bm_flimit (free buffer limit) does not exceed
**	    90% of cache; if so, silently reduce it to that value.
**	01-apr-2004 (devjo01)
**	    Only use CXmsg_redeem if DMCM & configured with a fast
**	    cluster long message facility (CX_HAS_FAST_CLM).
**      29-Sep-2004 (fanch01)
**          Add LK_LOCAL flag support as buffer names are confined to one node.
**	3-Jan-2006 (kschendel)
**	    Add connect-only flag for a caller (e.g. fastload) to connect
**	    to an existing shared cache (but never create one).  Rework
**	    connect code so that connects simply take all the parameters
**	    of the existing cache;  the old cross-check code was an artifact
**	    of the pre-config.dat configuration setup and was pointless.
**	10-May-2006 (jenjo02)
**	    Fix calculation of rounding slop needed for page-aligned
**	    lbm_pages.
**	15-Jun-2006 (kschendel)
**	    Above fix prevented overlaps, but didn't fix the underlying
**	    problem:  namely, that we can't force the CL (or the OS, even)
**	    to map the shared cache on a 64K boundary.  If one server
**	    maps a segment at address X+0 and another at X+8K, there is
**	    *no* position in the segment that is at a 64K boundary in
**	    both segments.  What happens is that the two servers think
**	    that the page pool starts at different positions -- not good!
**	    Give up on pagesize alignment, and align the page pool at
**	    ME_MPAGESIZE boundaries instead.  Hopefully that symbol is
**	    properly defined to be the shared-attach alignment (at least).
**	26-Jun-2006 (kschendel)
**	    It isn't.  Until we get this fixed at the CL level, hardcode
**	    4096 as the page alignment.  Too-small shouldn't hurt anything
**	    other than possibly messing up direct IO, but too-large is deadly.
**	20-Jun-2007 (bonro01)
**	    Initialize local pointer array for code path where
**	    shrbuf_connect=TRUE
**	    This will prevent uninitialized values from being saved in the
**	    shared memory segment and prevent abends during dm0p_deallocate()
**	    when dmf_svcb->svcb_bmseg[] pointers are referenced.
**	    This problem was introduced by change 480471.
**	04-Apr-2008 (jonj)
**	    Note in bmcb_status BMCB_NO_GLC if Cluster support does not
**	    include Global Lock Container locking. This affects how we cache
**	    lock with DMCM.
**
**	    If Clustered DMCM with shared cache and no GLC support (VMS only)
**	    utilize DMCM strategies for -all- tables, including system tables.
**	    By holding stronger locks on cached system tables, the number of
**	    lock requests that have to be passed to the GLC thread is greatly
**	    reduced. As with other tables, system table pages will remain 
**	    cached until tossed to make room, or due to a blocking callback.
**	30-May-2008 (jonj)
**	    LSNs consist of 2 u_i4's; display them in hex rather than 
**	    signed decimal.
**	01-Mar-2010 (jonj)
**	    Bug 123354: If memory problems allocating cache, return
**	    E_DM0112_RESOURCE_QUOTA_EXCEEDED rather than E_DM930A_DM0P_ALLOCATE.
**	    Initialize sys_err jic otherwise unused. Fix up TRdisplay of
**	    very large cache sizes as long decimal.

	** Separate buffer pools are managed for each page size, 2k, 4k,
	** 8k, 16k, 32k, 64k. All are optional, but at least one must
	** be specified.
	**
	** Note that these buffer pools may be physically allocated
	** in separate segments of memory OR any pool may be allocated
	** with any other.
	**
	**
	** Each segment of buffer manager memory contains the following
	** sections. Each section is quad word aligned.
	**
	**    - The Buffer Manager Segment Control Block (BMSCB) comes first.
	**      It has a fixed size.
	**      It contains offsets to interesting sections of buffer manager
	**      that were allocated contiguous with the BMSCB.
	**      For example, the BM_COMMON section, BMCACHE(s) and BMCACHE(s)
	**
	** The following sections are allocated only with the first allocated
	** segment:
	**
	**    - The BM_COMMON containing information common for all pools.
	**      It has a fixed size.
	**
	**    - Next comes the database and table cache entries.  These are
	**      used to hold cache locks on closed databases and tables so
	**      that pages can remain in the cache until they are opened
	**      again.  The number of these entries are determined by the
	**      dm0p_allocate arguments 'dbc_size' and 'tbc_size'.
	**
	** The following sections contain information for a specific
	** buffer pool. If more than one buffer pool is allocated in
	** one segment of buffer manager memory, the following sections
	** will follow for each pool.
	**
	**    - The DM0P_BMCB pool specific information. It has a fixed size.
	**
	**    - Next comes the hash buckets.  Buffers are linked onto a hash
	**      bucket according to its page no. and table id.  The space
	**      required for for the hash buckets is determined by the
	**      number of pages in the buffer pool.  The number of pages is
	**      rounded to the next power of two to get the number of
	**      buckets.  A bucket consists of a pointer to a buffer
	**      descriptor.
	**
	**    - Next comes the group descriptors.  There is one group
	**      descriptor for each set of group buffers.
	**
	**    - Next comes the buffer descriptors.  There is one buffer
	**      descriptor for each page in the buffer pool.  This includes
	**      a buffer descriptor for each group buffer page.
	**
	**    - Next comes the Consistency Point buffer id array, used to
	**      quickly elect apparently CP-eligible buffers and presort them
	**      prior to forcing.
	**
	**    - Next (if GatherWrite enabled) come the GatherWrite structures.
	**
	**    - Next comes the actual pages.
	**
	** Unless DM0P_NEWSEG is set for a pool, attempt to allocate all
	** pools in a single segment; if the segment runs out of memory,
	** start a new segment. If DM0P_NEWSEG is set, allocate that pool

** Name: dm0p_deallocate	- Deallocate the buffer manager.
**
** Description:
**	This routine deallocates the buffer manager control block, and
**	invalidates the server control block pointer to the BMSCB(s).If there is
**	no BMSCB then this routine returns success.
**
**	If the Buffer Manager is allocated in local memory, then deallocate the
**	BMCB and LBMCB.  If this is a shared buffer manager, then just
**	deallocate the LBMCB.
**
**	If this is a shared buffer manager, convert the buffer manager lock to
**	exclusive and decrement the connected server count and release the lock.
**
**	Also release the buffer manager lock list.  This lock list can be
**	shared by other servers if this is a shared buffer manager.  The locks
**	will only be released if this is the only server connected to the lock
**	list.
**
**	If this is the last server connected to the buffer manager, and there
**	are still fixed or modified pages, then signal an error.

** Inputs:
**
** Outputs:

**
** History:
**	15-oct-1985 (derek)
**          Created new for Jupiter.
**	28-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for Shared Buffer Manager.
**	 3-apr-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Pass MULTITHREAD flag when release buffer manager lock list.
**	    Don't decrement server count until assured we can disconnect from
**	    buffer manager successfully.
**	26-jun-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Destroy shared memory segment when last server disconnects rather
**	    than assuming it will be destroyed by the OS.
**	26-oct-92 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging Project:
**	      - Added deallocation of the new buffer manager transaction context
**		used by force_page to force the log file before writing pages.
**	      - Clean up buffer manager semaphore to protect usage of the
**		above transaction context.
**	25-feb-1993 (keving)
**	    => A Buffer Manager may be associated with many logs. We deallocate
**	    => the txid of each log we have.
**	18-oct-1993 (rachael) merged 25-mar-1993 (bryanp) B47950,B50252
**	    Just adding a comment here to assert that we do not need to check
**	    for LK_VAL_NOTVALID when converting the buffer manager lock up to
**	    LK_X. If we do get LK_VAL_NOTVALID, then we treat it as a fatal
**	    error and crash the server. There should be no way that we can
**	    ever get LK_VAL_NOTVALID for this lock request unless some other
**	    server which is connected to this cache has crashed while holding
**	    the buffer manager lock, in which case the cache is suspect and
**	    crashing this server is an appropriate thing to do.
**      06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Multiple buffer pools in support of variable page sizes.
**      01-aug-1996 (nanpr01 for ICL phil.p)
**          Added call to dmcm_cache_flush to flush the cache of pages
**          locked by this server prior to server shutdown.
**      29-Sep-2004 (fanch01)
**          Add LK_LOCAL flag support as buffer names are confined to one node.

** Name: dm0p_register_loghandles   - Adds a set of logs to the Buffer Manager.
**
** Description:
**	Once a Buffer Manager has been allocated it has a reference to and
**	context for its local log. This routine is used by VAX recovery. It
**	allows the CSP to register a set of extra logs with the buffer manager.
**	Once this has been done the buffer manager will force all logs when
**	throwing out modified pages.
**
**	Should allow us to incrementally add logs as required, but this
**	isn't tested.
**
** Inputs:
**	lctx_array			Pointer to array of log contexts.
**	num_logs			Number of log contexts passed.
**
** Outputs:
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK
**	    E_DB_ERROR
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    Adds default lxids for each log to lbmcb.
**
** History:
**	2-Mar-1993 (keving)
**          Created for 6.5
**	26-apr-1993 (keving)
**	    Instead of using the lxids from the lctx_array we now start
**	    new log transactions for the buffer manager.
**	20-sep-1993 (andys)
**	    Fix arguments to ule_format call.

/*{
** Name: dm0p_fix_page	- Assign a page to a transaction.
**
** Description:
**	The page requested by the caller is made valid in the buffer pool. 
**	The process of making a page valid involves validating a
**	page that is already in the buffer pool and/or reading the
**	page fresh from the disk.  The buffer manager sets page locks
**	on behalf of the transaction requesting the page.  It will
**	also sets server locks for cooperating buffer managers.
**	
**	When the caller asks to fix a page, it gives it's intended
**	access for the page either READ or WRITE.  If the request was
**	for a physical lock, for example, pages looked at during a
**	btree search, the lock request is made with a qualifier that 
**	allows the lock to be released before the transaction completes.
**	If the lock was previously requested without physical locking or
**	is requested in the future without physical locking, the lock is
**	made transaction. If CREATE is requested, then the page is not
**      read from disk. This is used for extending a file.
**
**	The MUSTLOCK qualifier is used to override READLOCK=NOLOCK setting.
**	Btree fix_page calls for non-leaf index pages use this option to
**	walk the tree.
**
**	The following diagram depicts flow of control:
**
**			   CALL
**			     |
**			XACT_LOCK_PAGE
**			     |---------------+
**			  ESCALATE           |
**		+----------->|<--------------+
**		|	   MUTEX
**		|  	     |
**		+------- FIX_PAGE  ----+
**              |   +--------|	       |
**		|   |	VALIDATE_PAGE -|
**		|   +--------|         |
**		+------- FAULT_PAGE    |
**			     |<--------+
**			  RETURN  
**
**	The when a page is fixed for WRITE the transaction id is
**      written to the page buffer.  When it is fixed for shared
**      no specific transaction owns the buffer page since multiple
**      transactions can have it fixed.  A shared page becomes
**      owned by the last transaction to unfix the page.  Fixed pages
**      that are owned by a specific transaction are kept on a 
**      transaction hash queue so that they may be easily found
**      when the transaction ends.  Unless Fast Commit is in use, all
**	pages that are owned by a transaction that have been modified
**      must be written to disk before the transaction is committed.
**      This hash queue reduces the search through all pages to see
**      if any pages belong to the transaction which is ending.
** 
**      Note, physical locks are always obtained for a table, 
**      even when table level locking is specified and the page
**      is wanted for READ.  This must be done since there is no
**      way in dm0p_unfix_page to determine if the lock needs
**      to be released.
**     
**      To solve numerous race conditions and error handling
**      problems in the multi-thread environment the following
**      rules must be obeyed:
**         o  All operations that wait must be handled outside
**            the buffer manager mutex.
**         o  The lock value must change everytime the page
**            is written.  The value lock is always in 
**            IS mode except when it is being written.  Then
**            it is in SIX mode.
**         o  Group buffers never appear on the free or modifed queue
**            of the single page buffers.
**         o  Group buffers are not aged and single buffers
**            are only aged when a page needs to be read.
**         o  Disk I/O errors on writes, mark the buffer such
**            that only a dm0p_tran_invalidate call can release them.  Thus 
**            the calling transaction must abort to release the buffers.
**
**      Dm0p_fix_page is called with the following fix actions:
**
**	    DM0P_READ		- fix page for read only - the page cannot
**				  be modified while fixed for read.
**	    DM0P_PHYSICAL	- request physical lock on page.  This is
**				  probably a system catalog page or a btree
**				  index page.
**	    DM0P_WRITE		- fix page for write - the page can be
**				  modified.
**	    DM0P_CREATE		- page just been allocated and has not been
**				  formatted on disk.  Read it in and format it.
**	    DM0P_CREATE_NOFMT	- page may have just been allocated. Read it in, but
**				  mutex it insted of formatting it. It's up to
**				  the caller to decide on formatting, and the
**				  caller's responsibility to unmutex the page.
**	    DM0P_NOREADAHEAD	- do not use read-ahead.  Caller is indicating
**				  that this is not a sequential scan.
**	    DM0P_LOCKREAD	- used for BTREE index pages to make sure that
**				  readlocks are aquired on index pages even
**				  when using read-nolock.
**	    DM0P_TEMPLOCK	- 
**	    DM0P_NOWAIT		- do not wait for page lock.  If page can't be
**				  locked, return an error.
**	    DM0P_NOLOCK		- Do not place a transaction lock on this page.
**
** Inputs:
**      rcb                             The RCB that wants the page.
**      page_number                     The page number to fix.
**      action                          The specific fix action.
**
** Outputs:
**      page                            The pointer to the fixed page.
**      err_code                        Reason for error return.

**
** History:
**	15-oct-1985 (derek)
**          Created for Jupiter.
**	22-Jan-1987 (ac)
**	    Added code for readahead support.
**	 5-oct-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Added DM0P_NOWAIT action.
**	 6-dec-1988 (rogerk)
**	    After fixing a page, turn off the BUF_CACHED bit that specifies
**	    that we must validate the page when fixing it.  We can't do this
**	    in validate_page() as we don't know whether the page has been
**	    locked or not.
**	28-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for Shared Buffer Manager.
**	    Took out resetting of BUF_TEMP_FIXED status as it is unset in
**	    fault_page.
**	17-mar-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Fixed read nolock bug introduced with shared buffer manager changes.
**	25-sep-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Fixed PASS_ABORT problem.  When faulting in readnolock buffer, check
**	    if system is in recovery state.  If it is, then toss the buffer out
**	    of the cache.
**	25-sep-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Make sure we put buffer on transaction list when fix it for WRITE
**	    even if the buffer is already fixed.  If the buffer is fixed only
**	    for READ then it will not be on the transaction list.  Moved code
**	    to buffer on xact queue out of 1st-fix-only code.
**	25-sep-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Don't lock pages in X mode if DM0P_RPHYS action is specified.  This
**	    causes us to lock BTREE index pages in X mode when table is open
**	    for write.
**	17-jul-1990 (mikem)
**	    bug #30833 - force aborts sometimes missed.
**	    It is possible, timing related, for a lock to be granted at exactly
**	    the same time as an interrupt (such as a FORCE ABORT notification) 
**	    is recieved.  LKrequest has been changed to return a new status
**	    (LK_INTR_GRANT) if this situation occurs.  In this case the lock
**	    has been granted but dmf's action is the same as if the lock request
**	    had been interrupted, with one exception.
**
**	    The exception is that any short term locks (such as core system 
**	    catalogue pages), which are usually released by dm0p_unfix_page() 
**	    following successful completion of dm0p_fix_page().  In this case
**	    we check for this magic return and make sure the page is unlocked
**	    before returning error from dm0p_fix_page().
**	 4-feb-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for fixed buffer priorities.
**	    Don't adjust buffer priority on reference if it is marked as
**	    having a fixed priority.
**	6-jun-1991 (bryanp)
**	    Added message E_DM9C08_OUT_OF_LOCKS when lock quota is exceeded.
**	19-aug-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Changed checks for xact abort in escalate processing.  We do
**	    not want to escalate to table level locking during transaction
**	    recovery.  The old check thought that Set Nologging transactions
**	    were always in abort state.  Changed to actually lookup the
**	    transaction state before escalating.  Exception is when running
**	    as the RCP or CSP in which case we assume we are doing transaction
**	    recovery. 
**	17-oct-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Merged changes made by Derek during the file extend project.
**	    Added new flags DM0P_NOLOCK, DM0P_FHFMSYNC and DM0P_MUTEX.
**	    Added trace flags in xDEBUG code.
**	    Added new session statistics collecting.
**	    Added support for DM0P_CREATE flag on existing pages.
**	19-Nov-1991 (rmuth)
**	    Removed action DM0P_FHFMSYNC.
**	14-may-1992 (bryanp)
**	    B44260: rcb_lk_limit should not apply during transaction abort.
**	05_jun_1992 (kwatts)
**	    MPF change, call to format page now uses accessor.
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging Project:
**	      - Changes to page locking logic:  decide on page lock mode based 
**		on the original requested lock mode at table open time rather 
**		than on the currently held lock mode.  The currently held lock 
**		mode may be IX due to a previous write query in the current 
**		transaction, but if this is a read query we want to do shared 
**		page locking. Also, dm2t now sets rcb_lk_type correctly to PAGE
**		or TABLE even when the granted lock mode is SIX, so that lock 
**		mode no longer needs to be taken into account when decided 
**		whether a page lock is needed.
**	      - Added check for (action & PHYSICAL) in the case when we release
**		a physical lock granted just before receiving an interrupt 
**		notice.  Previously we were checking for rcb_k_duration which 
**		would catch any system catalog page locks but would miss other 
**		physical requests like btree index pages.
**	      - Added before image check when fixing pages for update.
**	      - Moved page lock request into dm0p_lockpage routine.
**	      - Moved work which actually fixes pages into dm0p_cachefix_page.
**	      - Changed DM0P_SCRATCH handling.  Newly allocated pages will not
**		be marked MODIFIED when formatted as a new page.  This prevents
**		background processes from writing the new page to the database
**		before the callers updates are written to the page.
**	      - Removed DM0P_MUTEX option.  Pages must now be mutexed explicitly
**		by callers while updating them and the buffer manager will no
**		mark newly allocated pages as DIRTY.
**	18-feb-1993 (rmuth)
**	    If encounter an error calling dm0p_cachefix_page use 
**	    dm0p_log_error as this routine understands which errors to
**	    preserve and pass upto the higher layers.
**	26-apr-1993 (bryanp)
**	    6.5 Cluster Project:
**		It's now illegal to fix more than one system catalog page for
**		    write at a time. Enforce this restriction here.
**		Took out special CSP page locking semantics. The page locking
**		    behavior of CSP recovery is now handled directly by the
**		    recovery code and by the locking system.
**	26-jul-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Change generation of Before Image log records during Online Backup.
**	    Instead of calling before_image_check on every dm0p_fixpage 
**	    operation, we now expect the modifier of the page to call 
**	    dm0p_before_image_check before changing its contents.
**	23-may-1994 (andys)
**	    Add new parameter to dm0p_log_error which says whether to print
**	    the error which we are throwing away. We pass the flag saying not 
**	    to log the error when the flag DM0P_USER_TID is passed to 
**	    dm0p_fix_page, dm0p_cachefix_page or fault_page. This flag is
**	    only currently set by dm1r_get when it is doing a get by tid.
**	    [bug 49726]
**	19-apr-1995 (cohmi01)
**	    When running in 'batch mode', always use READAHEAD.
**	20-jun-95 (lewda02)
**	    Make DM0P_LOCKREAD override some other page lock options.
**	17-jul-1995 (cohmi01)
**	    Backout lewda02 DM0P_LOCKREAD change - causes page locks
**	    when not needed - eg when entire table is already locked,
**	    and thwarts the intent of other rcb flags related to locking.
**	    For Readahead thread - check for rcb interrupt  indicator
**	    so that cancelled/stale requests incur no extra IO. This rcb_uiptr
**	    actually points into the prefetch request block and will be set
**	    by user thread even though we execute on behalf of readahead thr.
**	30-may-1996 (pchang)
**	    Added support for DM0P_NOESCALATE action, to be used by sessions
**	    already holding an X lock on the FHDR when fixing pages other than
**	    an FMAP (i.e. without the DM0P_NOLOCK action).  Lock escalation 
**	    under such condition may lead to unrecoverable deadlock involving 
**	    the table-level lock and the FHDR. (B76463) 
**	    Also, changed to display the E_DM9041_LK_ESCALATE_TABLE message 
**	    only prior to actual lock escalation.
**      06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Multiple buffer pools in support of variable page sizes.
**	4-jul-96 (pchang)
**	    More changes to escalation handling.
**	17-jul-96 (nick)
**	    Differentiate between an LK resource derived escalation and one
**	    caused by exceeding the RCB lock limit. #77808
**	22-jul-96 (nick)
**	    Move some code out of here so we can use it elsewhere.
**      22-nov-96 (dilma04, stial01)
**          Row Locking Project:
**          - simplify access_mode calculation;
**          - call dm0p_page_lock_mode to figure out the lock mode;
**          - latch the page when row locking and no phantom protection.
**	16-Mar-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Don't use NOREADLOCK buffer if the action is DM0P_WRITE. Read_only
**	    transactions are allowed to fix, mutex, modify, and write temporary
**	    tables.
**      14-may-97 (dilma04)
**          Cursor Stability Project:
**          - added lock_id argument to dm0p_lock_page(), dm0p_unlock_page()
**          and dm0p_trans_page_lock() calls;  
**          - implemented lock coupling for CS and RR isolation levels.

** Name: dm0p_unfix_page	- Unfix page from a transaction.
**
** Description:
**	The page is unfixed for the caller.  If the reference count goes
**	to zero, the page is not fixed by any transaction at this point
**	in time.  The page is transfered into the free priority queue or
**	into the modify priority queue depending on the need for the buffer
**	to be written back to disk.  If the modify threshold has been
**	reached, the lowest priority dirty buffer is written back so that
**	this buffer can be placed on the modify queue.

**	    asynchronous write behind window, then signal the write behind
**	    threads.
**	31-oct-1988 (rogerk)
**	    When moving buffer to modified queue, put it at the end of its
**	    priority queue instead of at the beginning.  This is so older
**	    pages will be forced out first causing us to do fewer log forces.
**	28-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for Shared Buffer Manager.
**	    Pass tcb pointer to force_page calls.
**	    Use STRUCT_ASSIGN to save buffer lock key.
**      11-sep-1990 (jonb)
**	    Integrate ingres6301 change 280136 (rogerk):
**            Pass buf_tcb_stamp value to dm2t_get_tcb_ptr.
**	10-jan-1991 (rachael)
**	    Added error messages e_dm934c and e_dm934d to record
**	    more information before dmd_check.
**	3-may-1991 (bryanp)
**	    Make dmd_checks more useful by logging detailed error information
**	    before calling dmd_check.
**	17-oct-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Merged changes made by Derek during the file extend project.
**	    Added new DM0P_MRELEASE action.
**	    Handle new Write-on-Unfix, Write-on-PassAbort and NoLock sts flags.
**	    Added trace flags in xDEBUG code.
**	    Added new session statistics collecting.
**	21-jan-1992 (jnash)
**	    Toss pages marked TUNFIX.
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)  Reduced Logging Project:
**	  - Moved page lock release into dm0p_unlockpage routine.
**	  - Moved work which actually unfixes pages into dm0p_uncachefix_page.
**	  - Removed DM0P_MRELEASE option.  Pages must now be mutexed and
**	    unmutexed explicitly by callers while updating them.
**	  - Removed comment that DM0P_RELEASE option causes the page to be
**	    written if modified - this was not true.
**	  - Changed to pass down the DM0P_RELEASE option if pages are listed
**	    as being physically locked (rcb_k_duration is RCB_K_PHYSICAL).
**	    This is used for system catalog pages.  The buffer manager no 
**	    longer assumes that such pages will be listed WUNFIX.
**	  - Changed values of unfix action flags to be bit values rather
**	    than mutually exclusive integer values.  Dm0p_unfix continues
**	    to accept only mutually exclusive settings but may OR together
**	    action specifications for dm0p_uncachefix_page calls.
**	22-feb-1994 (andys)
**	    Add call to dm0p_check_consistency.
**      04-apr-1995 (dilma04) 
**          Add support for rcb_k_duration == RCB_K_CURSOR_STABILITY and
**          rcb_k_duration == RCB_K_REPEATABLE_READ.
**      06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Multiple buffer pools in support of variable page sizes.
**      06-may-1996 (nanpr01)
**          Change the reference to the page header with macros for
**	    New Page Format.
**      22-nov-96 (dilma04)
**          Row Locking Project:
**          If row locking and no phantom protection release the latch.
**      06-jan-97 (dilma04)
**          Removed the optimization to release an intent page lock if
**          no qualifying records are found on the page. This is because
**          of the situation when there are multiple cursors opened for
**          the same transaction with different lock granularity levels.
**          In this situation a page lock can be granted in a higher mode,
**          than it was requested. Such a lock should not be released in
**          this routine, but there is no way to know about it.
**      12-feb-97 (dilma04)
**          Set Lockmode Cleanup:
**          - test rcb_iso_level for isolation level;
**          - use macro to check for serializable transaction.
**	26-feb-97 (dilma04)
**	    Lock Escalation for Lower Isolation Levels:
**	    If isolation level is repeatable_read and page being unfixed
**	    is a non-modified data page containing at least one qualifying
**	    record returned by dm2r_get(), convert page lock from physical
**	    to logical. In all other cases behave as if isolation level
**	    were cursor_stability.
**      14-may-97 (dilma04)
**          Cursor Stability Project:
**          - lock coupling for CS and RR: instead of releasing a page lock
**          here, do it in dm0p_fix_page after the next lock is acquired;
**          - moved lock conversion for RR to dm2r_get() routine; 
**          - added lock_id argument to dm0p_unlock_page() calls.
**      21-may-97 (stial01)
**          dm0p_unfix_page: Remove release of LK_PH_PAGE locks
**      13-jun-97 (dilma04)
**          Repeatable Read optimization: set flag to release leaf page's 
**          lock, if page has not been updated.
**	25-Jun-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Don't assume a buffer is on transaction queue just because 
**	    page is fixed for write, but check explicitly. Remove buffer
**	    from txn queue when unfixed.
**	02-apr-1999 (nanpr01)
**	    Update mode lock -- For repeatable read, we must convert the
**	    update mode lock to logical shared.

**
** Inputs:
**	tbio				Table IO Control Block.
**	page_number			The page number in the table.
**	access_mode			The page access mode: read or write.
**      action                          The action to fix page
**	lock_list			Lock List Id
**	log_id				Log Id
**	tran_id				Pointer to Transaction Id
**	readnolock_buffer		Page buffer for readnolock use
**	format_routine			Routine to format new page
**	RedoLSN				Supplied during online Cluster REDO
**					recovery to check LSN of page
**					without need of SV_PAGE lock.
** Outputs:
**	page				Set to page in cache
**	err_code			Reason for error return status.
**	Returns:

**	18-feb-1993 (rmuth)
**	    If encounter an error calling [g]fault_page use

/*
** Name: fault_page	- Fault a page from disk into the buffer pool.

** Description:
**      This routine allocates a free buffer in the buffer pool and
**	reads the buffer from disk.  The buffer manager guarantees that a
**	free buffer is always available.  A free buffer is a buffer that
**	is not fixed and not modified.  If there are no free buffers, then
**	the caller will write dirty buffers in order to free them up.  The
**	caller that writes dirty buffers will return with the action set to
**	RETRY, so that a new search of the buffer pool is initiatated to see
**	if the page exists now.
**
**	The following diagram depicts the control flow:

**
**	The caller must hold the buffer manager mutex when calling this
**	routine.  The mutex will be released while lock and I/O calls
**	are made.
**
**	When called with the DM0P_CREATE flag, a new data page is allocated
**	in the buffer cache, but no page is read from disk.  The buffer is
**	marked BUF_EXTENDPAGE until it is forced to disk.  This prevents any
**	asynchronous threads from trying to force the page until it can be
**	safely written to disk.
**
** Inputs:
**      rcb                             The RCB for the table.
**      action                          The action to fix page, indicated
**                                      if this is a CREATE request.
**	page_number			The page number in the table.
**	access_mode			The page access mode: read or write.
**	bucket				The hash bucket for this buffer.
**
** Outputs:
**	buffer				The allocated buffer.
**	err_code			Reason for error return status.
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK			Success.
**	    E_DB_WARN			Restart operation.
**	    E_DB_ERROR			Error occured.
**	    E_DB_FATAL			DMF fatal error.
**	Exceptions:
**	    E_DM9202_BM_BAD_FILE_PAGE_ADDR err_code is expected
**          when extenting an old file with the new allocation scheme.
**
** Side Effects:
**	The buffer is left in BUSY state while Lock and IO calls are made.
**
** History:
**	04-jun-1986 (Derek)
**          Created for Jupiter.
**	22-Jan-1987 (ac)
**	    Added code for readahead support.
**	30-sep-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Added write behind thread support.  If free count is below
**	    free limit, then signal the write behind threads to free up some
**	    space in the buffer manager.
**	31-oct-1988 (rogerk)
**	    When moving modified buffer to new priority queue, put it at the 
**	    end of the queue instead of at the beginning.  This is so older
**	    pages will be forced out first causing us to do fewer log forces.
**	28-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for Shared Buffer Manager.
**	    Moved check for out-of-buffers below for performance.
**	    Moved formatting of buffer descriptor before researching hash
**	    chains after force_page.  This is to make it easier to break
**	    up the buffer manager mutex.
**	    Turn off BUF_TEMP_FIXED status before returning.
**	10-jul-1989 (rogerk)
**	    When creating scratch page, turn on BUF_EXTENDPAGE to signify
**	    that this is a newly allocated page.  This will prevent other
**	    threads (fc thread) from trying to force it out of the cache,
**	    since it can only be forced by the server which allocated it.
**	07-aug-1989 (mikem)
**	    Do not automatically turn off BUF_EXTENDPAGE bit at bottom of page
**	    (previous code turned it off thinking it was an error case rather than
**	    the normal path through.)
**	28-aug-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Pass correct arguments to dm0p_ewait routine when waiting for
**	    a buffer to become free.
**	 2-oct-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Fix NOLOCKS bug.  When can't acquire cache lock, set status to
**	    E_DB_ERROR correctly.
**	 2-oct-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Fix Consistency Point Bug.  If fault in buffer while in the
**	    middle of a consistency point, mark the buffer with the current
**	    CP number.  This indicates that this buffer does not need to be
**	    flushed as part of the current CP.
**	30-oct-1989 (rogerk)
**	    When invalidate page that got an IO error, don't decrement the
**	    fixed count as it is done in invalidate_page.
**      11-sep-1990 (jonb)
**	    Integrate ingres6301 change 280136 (rogerk):
**            When we fault in a page, write the tcb's validation stamp into
**            the buffer header.  This allows other servers attached to a common
**            buffer manager to validate their tcb's without having to re-
**            request the tcb lock.  Also, pass buf_tcb_stamp value to 
**            dm2t_get_tcb_ptr.
**	 4-feb-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for fixed buffer priorities.
**	    Added checks in fault_page for table's priority to override the
**	    buffer manager default priorities.  Added checks for BUF_PRIOFIX
**	    before altering a buffer's priority by clock or on reference.
**	3-may-1991 (bryanp)
**	    Make dmd_checks more useful by logging detailed error information
**	    before calling dmd_check.
**	17-oct-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Merged changes made by Derek during the file extend project.
**	    Handle new Write-on-Unfix and Write-on-PassAbort buffer flags.
**	    Call dm1c_format to initialize page instead of doing it inline.
**	    Added trace flags in xDEBUG code.
**	    Added new session statistics collecting.
**	    Added new error messages.
**	19-Nov-1991 (rmuth)
**	    Removed the action type DM0P_FHFMSYNC, check the page type
**	    to see if it is a FMAP or FHDR and act accordingly. See
**	    code for comments.
**      21-jan-92 (jnash)
**	    If FHDR/FMAP, Btree ROOT or INDEX page faulted in, mark
**	    PAWRITE.  If Pass Abort, also mark TUNFIX.
**	05_jun_1992 (kwatts)
**	    MPF change, call to format page now uses accessor.
**	07-oct-1992 (jnash)
**	    6.5 reduced logging project.
**	     -  Validate the page checksum after reading the page.
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**	  - Reduced logging project: changed references to tcb fields to
**	    use new tcb_table_io structure fields.
**	  - Changed the code which picks buffer weighting constants to be
**	    less dependent upon the structure types and gear more off of
**	    the page type itself.  During many page recovery operations, the
**	    storage type of the table is unknown.  Also made CHAIN page
**	    type mean the same as LEAF for priority weighting since it is
**	    a type of leaf page.  Changed from old dm2t_get_tcb_ptr to new 
**	    fix_tableio_ptr.  Added check to bypass group operations with 
**	    partial tcb's.
**	  - Changed lock_mode parameter to access_mode to divorce a little
**	    bit from page/table lock modes.
**	  - Changed DM0P_SCRATCH page handling to not mark the new
**	    page as MODIFIED.  The page is formatted (since a garbage page
**	    cannot be left in the cache), but it is up to the caller to
**	    format the page appropriately, write the correct LSN, tran_id
**	    and sequence number, and to mark the page as modified.
**	  - Took out old settings of cache locks on pages marked WUNFIX
**	    or readnolock during passabort.  These are handled now by
**	    tossing the pages at unfix time.
**	  - Removed requirement that system catalog pages use cache locks.
**	    They are now handled with the special Pass-Abort protocols
**	    shared by FMAP,FHDR and Btree Index pages.
**	  - Changed error handling a little bit to make sure trace back erorr
**	    messages are logged.  Moved check for error return from page
**	    read operations to before buffer fields begin to be initialized.
**	30-October-1992 (rmuth)
**	    Changes the read past end-of-file checking, see the 
**	    tcb_lpageno check for more info.
**	14-dec-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Changed temporary tables to not set PAWRITE fields since there are
**	    no concurrency or recovery issues.
**	05-mar-1993 (andys)
**	    Use DB_FAILURE_MACRO to check return status of dm0p_reclaim
**	    as it sometimes returns E_DB_WARN which is OK for us right here
**	    right now.
**	08-feb-1993 (rmuth)
**	    If encounter an error reading or checking the page call
**	    dm0p_log_error as this routine understands which errors to
**	    preserve and pass upto the higher layers.
**	24-may-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Trace cache locking if trace point DM302 is set.
**	23-aug-1993 (andys)
**	    Don't use DB_FAIL_MACRO in [g]fault_page calls to dm0p_reclaim
**	    so that we know when we really can't get any more locks.
**	18-oct-1993 (rmuth)
**	    Add DMP_BMCB statistics.
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Changed the flimit enforcing code to select pages off of the
**	    start of the modify priority queues rather than the end of
**	    the queues to choos the least-recently-used pages as force
**	    victims.
**	22-feb-1994 (andys)
**	    Add call to dm0p_check_consistency.
**	23-may-1994 (andys)
**	    Add new parameter to dm0p_log_error which says whether to print
**	    the error which we are throwing away. We pass the flag saying not 
**	    to log the error when the flag DM0P_USER_TID is passed to 
**	    dm0p_fix_page, dm0p_cachefix_page or fault_page. This flag is
**	    only currently set by dm1r_get when it is doing a get by tid.
**	    [bug 49726]
**	26-jun-1995 (cohmi01)
**	    When selecting victim from free chain, take 'next' LRU buffer.
**      24-oct-1995 (thaju02/stoli02)
**          Added increment of buffer manager single sync write counter.
**      06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Multiple buffer pools in support of variable page sizes.
**	20-mar-1996 (nanpr01)
**	    Added page size as parameter to this routine. To compute
**	    the checksum pagesize is need since sizeof(*page) returns
**	    only the size of physical page.
**      06-may-1996 (nanpr01)
**          Change the reference to the page header with macros for
**	    New Page Format. 
**          Change the format routine paramter to i4 for u_i2.
**      01-aug-1996 (nanpr01 for ICL phil.p)
**          Introduced support for Distributed Multi-Cache Management (DMCM)
**          protocol. For DMCM, lock requests are made via
**          LKrequestWithCallback.
**	01-aug-1996 (nanpr01)
**	    If error condition, we have to invalidate the LKcallback
**	    routines. Page number checking was being done later had to
**	    be moved forward.
**	13-Sep-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    On successful return, assigned buffer will be returned 
**	    with its buf_mutex locked.
**      22-nov-96 (stial01,dilma04)
**          Row Locking Project:
**          Set BUF_X_LATCH, BUF_WUNFIX/BUF_PAWRITE when EXCL row locking
**	12-Feb-1997 (jenjo02)
**	  - Skip over buffers that are BUF_BUSY.
**	  - Use a free buffer instead of forcing a modified buffer as
**	    long as there are free buffers.
**	  - Give preference to modified pages that won't induce a
**	    log force.
**	  - Delay waking buffer waiters until we're about to return.
**	  - Use SHARE mutex when searching modified/free queues.
**	24-Feb-1997 (jenjo02 for somsa01)
**	    Cross-integrated 428939 from main.
**	    Added tbio_extended to checking fo Buffer Manager Force Protocols
**	    on core catalogs.
**	01-Apr-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Added stats for sychronous fixed priority forces.
**	    When looking for a buffer from the modify/free queues, initially skip
**	    over valid buffers with fixed priority; if we exhaust the queues
**	    without finding a non-fixed-priority buffers, rescan to force
**	    one.
**      21-may-1997 (stial01)
**          fault_page() Do not put buf with IX page lock on xn queue
**          Removed code for non-fast-commit when row locking (not allowed) 
**          Removed code for BUF_PAWRITE when IX lock. (pass abort not allowed)
**	19-Jan-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    When page is successfully faulted in, add it to the table's
**	    hash queue.
**	25-Jun-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Added test for DM0P_CREATE_COND action when faulting in a non-matching
**	    page. This flag is set by dm1p when it's unsure whether the "free"
**	    datapage it's trying to fix has been formatted or not. If this flag
**	    is on and we read a "bad" page, ignore the error and call the
**	    page formatting function.
**	07-Jul-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Defer releasing buf_mutex until after all buf_sts bits have been
**	    decided upon and set.
**	01-Sep-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    DM0P_CREATE_COND has become DM0P_CREATE_NOFMT. When passed, the 
**	    page is read but, instead of being formatted, it is mutexed and
**	    returned to the caller (dm1p.c, scan_map()) in that state.
**	03-Dec-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed test for, and skipping of, fixed priority buffers when
**	    scanning the modified and free queues. It ate CPUs and was really
**	    of no benefit.
**      12-jan-1999 (stial01)
**          fault_page() DM0P_CREATE_NOFMT: mutex buffer if !SINGLEUSER
**	21-Jan-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    In fault_page(), read the page if DM0P_CREATE_NOFMT and the page
**	    to be read is within the bounds of formatted pages for the table
**	    (page is being reused).
**	27-Jan-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    In fault_page(), put the table in hash bucket before acquiring
**	    the cache lock and reading the page. This should be OK since the 
**	    buffer is busy. This will close the hole, when the cache lock is
**	    found yet the buffer is not found in the cache by traversing 
**	    through tables bucket list. 
**	24-Aug-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    When reclaiming a buffer, mark it BUF_RECLAIM to signal force_page()
**	    to remove it from whatever state queue it's on but not insert it
**	    on the free queue. A reclaimed page is in the process of becoming
**	    "fixed" and there's no need to put it on a free queue just to have
**	    to immediately remove it again.
**	14-Sep-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Accurately count free buffers.
**	11-Oct-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    ifdef'd out clock aging. I don't know that this is really of any
**	    value, and it presents a multi-thread bottleneck on the clock_mutex.
**	    More tweaks to free/modified page search algorithms to ensure that
**	    we pick a free rather than modified page whenever possible.
**	10-Jan-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Cleaned up free/modified page search.
**	    If faulting in a temptable page, reduce its buffer
**	    priority by one to cause earlier aging of those
**	    pages.
**	23-Jun-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Added fill_option to dmpp_format() prototype, set by caller
**	    to DM1C_ZERO_FILL if dmpp_format should MEfill the page,
**	    DM1C_ZERO_FILLED if the page has already been MEfilled.
**	    The page overhead space is always zero-filled.
**	11-Oct-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Turn off "search_mod" when modified queues exhausted
**	    to prevent endless loop.
**	06-Jun-2002 (jenjo02)
** 	    Test of flimit in fault_page() was reversed, counting
**	    free pages when WB threads were running instead of when
**	    they were not. 
**      19-Jun-2002 (horda03) Bug 108074.
**          Whenever BUF_WUNFIX flag is set/cleared set/clear the BUF_WUNFIX_REQ
**          flag. Thus we keep track of buffers that should be flushed from
**          cache when UNfixed (if not protected by an exclusive table level
**          lock).
**	28-Jan-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed bogus
**	    DMPP_VPT_CLR_PAGE_STAT_MACRO(tbio->tbio_page_size, page, DMPP_MODIFY)
**	    cross-integrated from bug 108074, above. 
**	    "tbio_page_size" in this context rather than page_type
**	    made V1 pages look like >V1 pages, causing the DMPP_MODIFY
**	    bit (0x00000100) to be turned off in page_main, corrupting
**	    isam/hash chains.
**	01-Mar-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    Stuff partition number in buf_partno.
**      29-Sep-2004 (fanch01)
**          Conditionally add LK_LOCAL flag if database/table is confined
**          to one node.
**    28-Feb-2005 (wanfr01,jenjo02)
**          Bug 113547, INGSRV3062
**          Stop doing dirty reads if we are restarting the scan too
**          many times to avoid cpu thrashing.
**     6-sep-2005 (wanfr01, horda03)
**	    Bug 114776, INGSRV3348 
**	    Check the free queue count to avoid waiting needlessly
**	    for a WB thread, and make sure one is active if you do
**    22-sep-2006 (horda03) Bug 56705
**          Don't select a modified buffer to be forced, if the table
**          for the buffer is being materialized. This prevents a
**          semaphore deadlock.
**     20-sep-2006 (wonca01)
**          Bug 114776
**          Correction to cross integration of BUG 114776, where the
**          number of parameters passed to wb_cycle_start() differs
**          from the codeline where the change originated from.
**	28-Feb-2007 (jonj)
**	    Translate DM0P_NOLKSTALL action to LK_NOSTALL for cache locks.
**	06-Mar-2007 (jonj)
**	    Add RedoLSN parameter for online Cluster REDO.
**	    When non-NULL, do not acquire cache lock.
**	10-Oct-2007 (jonj)
**	    If DM0P_CSP_REDO and DM0P_CREATE, first read the page from the DB
**	    as other nodes may have updated the page; if it looks "good",
**	    use it, otherwise format it.
**	19-Oct-2007 (jonj)
**	    Do -not- checksum pages read with DM0P_CREATE_NOFMT. VMS, for one,
**	    does not initialized newly allocated pages, and the checksum
**	    will likely fail. dm1p requests CREATE_NOFMT and knows what to do.
**	30-Nov-2007 (jonj)
**	    Don't accept just any vague cl_status from the cache lock
**	    request - LK_NOLOCKS is ok, but others are more serious.
**	    Don't format page if cache lock request failed.

    ** Check for special Buffer Manager Force Protocols for this page.

    **     BUF_WCOMMIT - Buffer must be written at Commit/Abort time.
    **
    **         This is set for normal Ingres data pages when not running
    **         in FastCommit mode.  This flag causes this page to be forced
    **         to the database when dm0p_force_pages is called.
    **
    **     BUF_WUNFIX  - Buffer must be written when unfixed.
    **
    **         This is set for Ingres Pages which are updated with temporary
    **         physical locks (Sconcur catalogs, FHDR/FMAP pages, and Btree
    **         index pages) when the server is using Multi-Cache protocols
    **         OR the server is NOT using Fast Commit OR the client is the RCP.
    **
    **         These types of pages have the following properties which give 
    **         them special force protocols:
    **
    **           - Since the pages are not locked for transaction duration,
    **             other transactions may request to look at these pages before
    **             an update has been committed.  When the "other transactions"
    **             use a different cache, then they will see out-of-date
    **             versions if we don't force updates when the page locks
    **             are released.  (Note that rather than force the pages at
    **             unfix time we could build multi-cache protocols that allow
    **             one buffer manager to request a dirty page from another
    **             buffer manager ....)
    **
    **             When Multi-Cache protocols are in use or we are the RCP
    **             (in which case multi-cache protocols are asssumed since
    **             we may be executing a Pass-Abort) then BUF_WUNFIX must
    **             be defined on these page types.
    **
    **           - The buffer manager cannot currently keep track of the
    **             "owner" of a page that is updated by multiple sessions.
    **             When fast commit is not in use, the buffer manager must
    **             force all pages updated by a transaction at commit time.
    **             Since the buffer manager cannot remember when these types
    **             of pages are updated by a transaction, it must force them
    **             at Unfix time to avoid having to fix them at commit time.
    **
    **     BUF_TUNFIX - Buffer must be tossed at unfix time.
    **
    **         This is set for Ingres Pages which are updated with temporary
    **         physical locks (Sconcur catalogs, FHDR/FMAP pages, and Btree
    **         index pages) when the server has requested a Pass-Abort action
    **         and the server is not using multi-cache Cache Locks protocols.
    **
    **         When a Pass Abort is signaled, the RCP will possibly update
    **         page of this type that is in our cache.  If we are running
    **         in single-cache mode then we will not recognize when the pages
    **         in our cache are invalid.  We therefore toss any unlocked page
    **         while the RCP is executing a Pass Abort in the assumption that
    **         it may be invalidated.
    **
    **     BUF_PAWRITE - Buffer must be forced if a Pass Abort is signaled.
    **
    **         This is set for Ingres Pages which are updated with temporary
    **         physical locks (Sconcur catalogs, FHDR/FMAP pages, and Btree
    **         index pages).
    **
    **         When a Pass Abort is signaled, we must flush out any dirty
    **         pages which may be needed by the RCP during its abort processing
    **         since the RCP will be using a different cache.  Since ownership
    **         is not assigned for these types of pages, we simply force them
    **         all when a Pass Abort occurs. (Note that PAWRITE is not set
    **         when WUNFIX is used since no dirty pages of this type is ever
    **         left in the cache)
    **
    ** The absense of BUF_WCOMMIT or BUF_WUNFIX means that in normal
    ** circumstances (non pass-abort) the page needs not be written from
    ** the cache until the next Consistency Point.
    **
    ** None of these flags need be set on temporary tables.
    **
    ** -------------------------------------------------------------------
    ** (ICL phil.p)
    ** For DMCM, want pages to reside in cache until the next consistency
    ** point, or until we receive a contending lock request. So we don't
    ** set BUF_WCOMMIT or BUF_WUNFIX.
    ** Don't need to set BUF_PAWRITE because if the RCP requests any of
    ** the pages still in our cache, the contending lock request will
    ** activate the dm0p_dmcm_callback function forcing our pages to be
    ** written and/or dropped.
    ** System catalogs do participate in DMCM. At the end of a transaction,
    ** they are tossed from cache and their lock is converted down to NULL.

** Name: gfault_page	- Fault a group of pages from disk into the buffer 
**			  pool.
**
** Description:
**      This routine finds a free group in the buffer pool and
**	reads a group of pages from disk. This is so called the readahead
**	operation. A free group is a group with no fixed member pages. If there 
**	are no free groups, will get a group from the modified group queue.
**	If there are no gree groups and no modified groups, then the buffer 
**	manager will just read one page instead. The next read for the same 
**	rcb will try readahead operation again.
**
**	Any pages that already exist in single page buffers, are read in by
**	a group read and the duplicate pages are discarded by not entering
**	them into the hash queues.
**
**	The caller must have the buffer manager mutex to call this routine.
**	The mutex will be released to do I/O but will be reaquired before
**	returning.
**
** Inputs:
**      rcb                             The RCB for the table.
**      action                          The action to fix page.
**	page_number			The page number in the table for the
**					first page to read.
**	access_mode			The access mode for the first page to 
**					read - read or write.
**	bucket				The hash bucket for the first page to
**					read.
**
** Outputs:
**	buffer				The allocated buffer for the first page.
**	err_code			Reason for error return status.
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK			Success.
**	    E_DB_WARN			Restart operation using single buffer.
**	    E_DB_ERROR			Error occured.
**	    E_DB_FATAL			DMF fatal error.
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    Buffers are marked BUSY while being read.

**	    Made fixes in error handling when can't get cache locks.
**	28-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for Shared Buffer Manager.
**	29-jun-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Release buffer manager mutex while making IO and lock calls.
**	 4-sep-1989 (rogerk)
**	    When looking for group buffer to use, check for free group first,
**	    then look for modified group to reclaim.
**	25-sep-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Fix PASS_ABORT problem.  Don't allow group fault on database that
**	    has no cache locks while RCP is doing recovery for this server.
**	 2-oct-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Fix NOLOCKS bug.  When can't acquire cache lock, set status to
**	    E_DB_ERROR correctly.
**	 2-oct-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Fix Consistency Point Bug.  If fault in buffer while in the
**	    middle of a consistency point, mark the buffer with the current
**	    CP number.  This indicates that this buffer does not need to be
**	    flushed as part of the current CP.
**	30-oct-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Fixed uninitialized variable bug in gfault_page which caused us
**	    to not use any but the 1st page of the group read.
**      11-sep-1990 (jonb)
**	    Integrate ingres6301 change 280136 (rogerk):
**            When we fault in a page, write the tcb's validation stamp into
**            the buffer header.  This allows other servers attached to a common
**            buffer manager to validate their tcb's without having to re-
**            request the tcb lock.  Also, pass buf_tcb_stamp value to 
**	      dm2t_get_tcb_ptr.
**	 4-feb-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Changed calculation of page_count for group reads to avoid group
**	    IO's that span multi-location file boundaries.  Requesting a multi
**	    page IO that spans location boundaries takes more than one IO.
**	 4-feb-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for fixed buffer priorities.
**	    Added checks in fault_page for table's priority to override the
**	    buffer manager default priorities.
**	25-feb-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Put in temporary check for table cache priority that causes
**	    us to bypass group reads on the table.  This is here until we
**	    add priority queues for group buffers.  For now, we need to
**	    bypass group reads on table's with fixed priorites to keep
**	    the pages from being bumped out by the next scan operation.
**	    Also added trace flag DM426 to bypass group reads.
**	3-may-1991 (bryanp)
**	    Make dmd_checks more useful by logging detailed error information
**	    before calling dmd_check.
**	17-oct-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Merged changes made by Derek during the file extend project.
**	    New assumption is added : the special WUNFIX pages require
**	    cache locking during PASS ABORT on a sole server, since gfault_page
**	    is not used during PASS ABORT no new code needs to be added.
**	    Added new handling for EOF checking : use tcb_checkeof flag.
**	    Added checks for incorrect page numbers when a page is read in.
**	    Added trace flags in xDEBUG code.
**	    Added new session statistics collecting.
**	    Added new error messages.
**	19-Nov-1991 (rmuth)
**	    Added fixes for file extend and CONCUR tables when doing readahead.
**	    When faulting in a group of pages the buf_sts for any of the pages
**	    were not being set see code for comments.
**      21-jan-92 (jnash)
**          Add Btree root and index pages to those marked PAWRITE.
**	07-oct-1992 (jnash)
**	    6.5 reduced logging project.
**	     -  Validate the page checksums after reading the pages.
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**	  - Reduced logging project: changed references to tcb fields to
**	    use new tcb_table_io structure fields.  Changed from old
**	    dm2t_get_tcb_ptr to new fix_tableio_ptr.  Added check to bypass
**	    group operations with partial tcb's.
**	  - Changed lock_mode parameter to access_mode to divorce a little
**	    bit from page/table lock modes.
**	  - Took out old settings of cache locks on pages marked WUNFIX
**	    or readnolock during passabort.  These are handled now by
**	    tossing the pages at unfix time.
**	  - Removed requirement that system catalog pages use cache locks.
**	    They are now handled with the special Pass-Abort protocols
**	    shared by FMAP,FHDR and Btree Index pages.
**	  - Changed error handling a little bit to make sure trace back erorr
**	    messages are logged.  Moved check for error return from page
**	    read operations to before buffer fields begin to be initialized.
**	30-oct-1992 (rmuth)
**	    Add checks for reading past EOF of a temporary table.  The actual
**	    disk-allocated space for a temporary table may not match the
**	    value in tbio_lalloc (which indicates the virtual pages allocated
**	    to the table).  If a temporary table has 30 pages, but only the 1st
**	    ten have been forced to disk, then we can only group read up to
**	    page ten.  Added tbio_tmp_hw_pageno to track the highest disk-
**	    allocated page in a temporary table.
**	14-dec-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Changed temporary tables to not set PAWRITE fields since there are
**	    no concurrency or recovery issues.
**	05-mar-1993 (andys)
**	    Use DB_FAILURE_MACRO to check return status of dm0p_reclaim
**	    as it sometimes returns E_DB_WARN which is OK for us right here
**	    right now.
**	24-may-1993 (bryanp)
**	    If trace point DM302 is set, trace internal buffer manager cache
**		locks (useful mostly for debugging and testing purposes).
**	23-aug-1993 (andys)
**	    Don't use DB_FAIL_MACRO in [g]fault_page calls to dm0p_reclaim
**	    so that we know when we really can't get any more locks.
**	    In gfault_page, if dm0p_reclaim succeeds such that we retry,
**	    decrement the counter so that we retry the buffer we failed on.
**	18-oct-1993 (rmuth)
**	    Add DMP_BMCB statistics.
**	22-feb-1994 (andys)
**	    Add call to dm0p_check_consistency.
**	19-apr-1995 (cohmi01)
**	    If no free groups are found, in addition to writting out a
**	    modified group, signal the write-behind threads so that other
**	    ones will be written out, now that write-behinds handle groups.
**      24-oct-1995 (thaju02/stoli02)
**          Added increment of buffer manager group sync write counter.
**	23-jan-1996 (angusm)
**	    Prevent group read on multi-location internal temp tables:
**	    bug 72806.
**      06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Multiple buffer pools in support of variable page sizes.
**	20-mar-1996 (nanpr01)
**	    Added page size as parameter to this routine. To compute
**	    the checksum pagesize is need since sizeof(*page) returns
**	    only the size of physical page.
**      06-may-1996 (nanpr01)
**          Change the reference to the page header with macros for
**	    New Page Format. 
**      01-aug-1996 (nanpr01 & ICL phil.p)
**          Introduced changes for Disributed Multi-Cache Management (DMCM)
**          protocol.
**          Instead of locking the whole group at LK_IX, we lock the first
**          page at the same mode as the data page (or LK_X for a read_nolock
**          query) and all the subsequent pages at LK_S. (For concurrency
**          reasons we cannot lock all the pages at LK_X). The requests for
**          all but the first page, are made with NOWAIT specified. If we
**          are not granted the lock, then mark the buffer as BUF_FREE.
**          Once read, locks on all but the first pages are converted to null.
**          NB. The interface has been changed, so that we can pass in the
**              action parameter and hence check whether a query is
**              DM0P_READNOLOCK.
**	    Move the io_wait calculation after the buffer manager mutex
**	    was acquired.
**	01-Aug-1996 (nanpr01)
**	    Also check for LK_VAL_INVALID status to initialize the 
**	    buf_lock_mode field.
**	13-Sep-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    We'll return (if successful) with the group's 1st buffer's
**	    buf_mutex locked (but not the group's g_mutex).
**      22-nov-96 (stial01,dilma04)
**          Row Locking Project:
**          Set BUF_X_LATCH, BUF_WUNFIX/BUF_PAWRITE when EXCL row locking
**	24-Feb-1997 (jenjo02 for somsa01)
**	    Cross-integrated 428939 from main.
**	    Added tbio_extended to checking fo Buffer Manager Force Protocols
**	    on core catalogs.
**	26-Feb-1997 (jenjo02)
**	  - Use SHARE mutex while searching the free and modified group queues.
**	  - Give preference to modified groups that won't induce a log force.
**	13-Mar-1997 (jenjo02)
**	  - After calling gforce_page(), discard groups which may now be on
**	    the fixed queue.
**	  - When a group is selected, mark it G_RBUSY, ensure that all needed
**	    buffers are free.
**	16-Apr-1997 (jenjo02)
**	  - Moved test for recover state to the front of this function.
**	  - Removed BUF_MUSTLOCK status which was being used without the
**	    protection of the buf_mutex and replaced it with the local
**	    variable "must_lock".
**	  - Reorganized some code to close some windows that left the
**	    group unprotected while it was being updated. Use move_group()
**	    to manage group queues intelligently instead of bungling them
**	    up in here.
**      21-may-1997 (stial01)
**          gfault_page() Do not put buf with IX page lock on xn queue
**          Removed code for non-fast-commit when row locking (not allowed) 
**          Removed code for BUF_PAWRITE when IX lock. (pass abort not allowed)
**	28-Aug-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Redid group-busy logic, in general, lock group, set busy status, 
**	    unlock group, then lock buffer.
**	19-Jan-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    When pages are successfully faulted in, add them to the table's
**	    hash queue.
**	08-Sep-1998 (shero03)
**	    Change the hash algorithm to mod by the hash count.
**	27-Jan-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    In fault_page(), put the table in hash bucket before acquiring
**	    the cache lock and reading the page. This should be OK since the 
**	    buffer is busy. This will close the hole,when the cache lock is
**	    found yet the buffer is not found in the cache by traversing 
**	    through tables bucket list. 
**      08-Mar-1999 (wanya01)  
**           gfault_page(). Caller is responsible for awakening group waiters.
**	     This is 
**           addtional fix for bug 91942(change 436539) 
**      03-Feb-2000 (hanal04) Bug 83999 INGSRV100.
**          - Pass DM0P_TBIO_WARN_INVALID to fix_tableio_ptr() so that we do
**          not log disconcerting errors when we fail to find a TCB for
**          an index because the  base table's TCB has been invalidated. 
**	05-dec-2000 (thaju02 for jenjo02)
**	    Avoid forcing out a group containing modified pages if the 
**	    group is fixed. (cont. B94855)
**	10-Jan-2000 (jenjo02)
**	     Substantially rewritten to be more intelligent. Before
**	     tossing a group, see if enough of the pages we need are already
**	     in cache. Cull down the size of the group if some pages are
**	     already in cache (if the group is pages 1,2,3,4,5 and pages
**	     3,4,5 are in cache, just read 1 and 2, for example).
**	     Implemented group priority queues.
**	13-Apr-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Corrected loop in gfault_page() caused by earlier failed
**	    gfault_page() and mishandling of g_valcount.
**	08-Aug-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Remove test for WriteBehind in gfault_page(), which was
**	    causing group reads to be abandoned when they should not
**	    have been.
**      19-Jun-2002 (horda03) Bug 108074.
**          Whenever BUF_WUNFIX flag is set/cleared set/clear the BUF_WUNFIX_REQ
**          flag. Thus we keep track of buffers that should be flushed from
**          cache when UNfixed (if not protected by an exclusive table level
**          lock).
**      20-Aug-2002 (devjo01)
**          Add more logic to prevent futile gfault attempts, especially
**          when using internal threads. (b107914, b104299).
**	25-oct-2002 (devjo01)
**	    Prevent infinite CPU loop when checking for pages already in cache.
**	    b109051.
**	15-Nov-2002 (jenjo02)
**	    Added group state of "G_SKIPPED" to flag those groups
**	    discarded as candidates. Previously if two "skipped" groups
**	    were encountered, we'd loop between the two and never
**	    find a group. Part cause of B107914,B104299, above.
**	22-Nov-2002 (jenjo02)
**	    Readded "attempts" lost in previous change.
**	30-Jul-2003 (jenjo02) BUG 110646
**	    If error faulting in the group, reset BUF_RBUSY before
**	    tossing the pages, or fault_page() will put this
**	    thread to sleep.
**	18-Sep-2003 (jenjo02) SIR 110923
**	    Add "create" capability for groups, group consolidation.
**	10-Nov-2003 (jenjo02)
**	    Ensure that buf_cpfcb is populated.
**	01-Mar-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    Stuff partition number in buf_partno.
**      29-Sep-2004 (fanch01)
**          Conditionally add LK_LOCAL flag if database/table is
**	    confined to one node.
**	24-Jan-2005 (jenjo02)
**	    bs_greads[BMCB_PTYPES] reverted to counting one read for
**	    the entire group.
**    28-Feb-2005 (wanfr01,jenjo02)
**          Bug 113547, INGSRV3062
**          Stop doing dirty reads if we are restarting the scan too
**          many times to avoid cpu thrashing.
**	27-Apr-2005 (schka24)
**	    Include buf-hash-bucket in dirty test for is-page-in-cache,
**	    to prevent giving up on a page prematurely.  Reorder unmutexed
**	    buf setup to (try to) ensure that other threads don't see an
**	    interesting buf before they should.  Refine cpu-spin test.
**	11-Jul-2005 (schka24)
**	    Only consolidate for create variants, where it makes sense
**	    to try to grow onto the end of an existing group.  Consolidation
**	    is a waste for normal table scans.
**	14-Oct-2005 (jenjo02)
**	    Deleted Sequent-only (sqs_ptx) code to bypass group reads
**	    of temp tables. Sequent support deprecated.
**	26-Jan-2006 (kschendel)
**	    Turn on SKIPPED before tossing pages from proposed group, to
**	    eliminate race.  If we turn it on after, the force-failure
**	    condition might already be cleared and then there is nobody
**	    to ever turn SKIPPED off;  so the group becomes unavailable.
**	7-Feb-2006 (kschendel)
**	    Fix stupid typo in above, lost set-g-to-NULL, caused looping.
**      1-Mar-2006 (wanfr01)
**          Bug 114324
**          retry with single page read if you hit end of file.
**	12-Feb-2007 (jonj)
**	    Fix to Karl's G_SKIPPED fix, On E_DB_OK return from gforce_page,
**	    G_SKIPPED has been turned off and may need to be reenabled.
**	28-Feb-2007 (jonj)
**	    Translate DM0P_NOLKSTALL action to LK_NOSTALL for cache locks.
**	24-Sep-2007 (jonj)
**	    Buffers must be placed on table hash queue before cache locks
**	    are taken so if a blocking callback is fired dm0p_dmcm_callback()
**	    will be able to find it.
**	19-Oct-2007 (jonj)
**	    Do -not- checksum pages read with DM0P_CREATE_NOFMT. VMS, for one,
**	    does not initialized newly allocated pages, and the checksum
**	    will likely fail. dm1p requests CREATE_NOFMT and knows what to do.
**	30-Nov-2007 (jonj)
**	    When retrying cache lock on buffer, back up buffer
**	    pointer (b--) as well as page index (i--).
**	    Don't accept just any vague cl_status from the cache lock
**	    request - LK_NOLOCKS is ok, but others are more serious.
**	    If we have a lock problem, return E_DB_WARN to try a single
**	    page.

** Name: dm0p_pagetype - Give page type of newly created page.
**
** Description:
**	This routine must be called following the fixing of a page
**	with the DM0P_SCRATCH option.  
**
**	It must be called prior to unfixing the page.
**
**	(Since the buffer manager currently formats all scratch pages as
**	data pages, this call can optionally be bypassed for DATA pages.)
**
**	The routine allows the buffer manager to set any special buffer
**	fields that are particular to the page's type.  These actions
**	are normally performed by fault_page but cannot be done in
**	this case because the page has been newly formatted.
**
** Inputs:
**	tbio			    Table IO Control Block used to fix page.
**	page			    Pointer to the newly allocated page.
**	log_id			    Logging System Handle.
**	page_type		    Type of page - ONE (only one) of:
**					DMPP_FHDR
**					DMPP_FMAP
**					DMPP_DATA
**					DMPP_LEAF
**					DMPP_INDEX
**					DMPP_CHAIN
**
** Outputs:
**	none
** Returns:
**	VOID
**
** History:
**	14-dec-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Created as part of the reduced logging project.
**      27-july-1995 (carly01)
**	    b69767 - set buffer priority and type for "in memory" tables.
**      06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Multiple buffer pools in support of variable page sizes.
**      06-may-1996 (nanpr01)
**	    All page header access was replaced by macros for New Page Format
**	    project.
**      01-aug-1996 (nanpr01 for ICL phil.p)
**          Introduced support for the Distributed Multi-Cache Management
**          (DMCM) protocol. In effect, when running DMCM, don't set any of
**           the other Buffer Manager protocols.
**	24-Feb-1997 (jenjo02 for somsa01)
**	    Cross-integrated 428939 from main.
**	    Added tbio_extended to checking fo Buffer Manager Force Protocols
**	    on core catalogs.
**	27-Mar-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Added lock/unlock of buf_mutex, which was inexplicably omitted.
**	01-Feb-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Determine buf_type unconditionally, not just for temp tables.
**	    Added consistency check to ensure that the right page is mapped
**	    and that it's fixed.
**      19-Jun-2002 (horda03) Bug 108074.
**          Whenever BUF_WUNFIX flag is set/cleared set/clear the BUF_WUNFIX_REQ
**          flag. Thus we keep track of buffers that should be flushed from
**          cache when UNfixed (if not protected by an exclusive table level
**          lock).

/*{
** Name: dm0p_uncache_fix	- Unfix a buffer in the page cache.
**
** Description:
**	This routine unfixes a page previously fixed by dm0p_cachefix_page.
**
** Inputs:
**	tbio				Table IO Control Block.
**      action                          The action to fix page
**	lock_list			Lock List Id
**	log_id				Log Id
**	tran_id				Pointer to Transaction Id
**	page				Page to unfix
**
** Outputs:
**	page				Pointer reset to NULL
**	err_code			Reason for error return status.
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK
**	    E_DB_ERROR
**
** History:
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**          Created for Reduced Logging Project.  Code moved here from old
**	    dm0p_unfix_page routine.
**	14-dec-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Chnaged consistency check which looked for pages being released
**	    by the transaction which had not been marked as PAWRITE by the
**	    buffer manager to bypass temporary tables and pages not fixed 
**	    for Update.
**	20-sep-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Restore accidentally-commented-out code in dm0p_uncache_fix.
**	18-oct-1993 (rmuth)
**	    Add DMP_BMCB statistics.
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Changed the mlimit enforcing code to select pages off of the
**	    start of the modify priority queues rather than the end of
**	    the queues to choos the least-recently-used pages as force
**	    victims.
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Added check for mlimit/flimit during LOGFULL conditions and
**	    the call to purge the current cache in this case.  This drastically
**	    reduces the amount of logforces required.
**	22-feb-1994 (andys)
**	    It is ok for mutex on buffer to be held if BUF_MUTEX_OK set.
**	23-may-1994 (jnash)
**	    The 18-oct-1993 change was off by one page, causing the code
**	    to never be executed.
**	27-jun-1995 (cohmi01)
**	    Use bitwise & instead of == for DM0P_FORCE test. 
**	24-oct-1995 (thaju02/stoli02)
**	    Added increment of buffer manager single sync write counter.
**      06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Multiple buffer pools in support of variable page sizes.
**	25-mar-96 (nick)
**	    Added FCwait support.
**      06-may-1996 (nanpr01)
**          Change the reference to the page header with macros for
**	    New Page Format.
**	12-Feb-1997 (jenjo02)
**	  - Lock status mutex while signalling DM0P_FWAIT_EVENT.
**	  - If the modify limit is breached and WB threads are running,
**	    let them be responsible for forcing modified buffers instead
**	    of stifling this thread with another I/O.
**	  - Use SHARE mutex when searching modified queue for a buffer to force.
**      21-may-1997 (stial01)
**        - dm0p_uncache_fix: Crash server if refcount is 0 and buffer is locked
**          Do not put buf with IX page lock on xn queue
**      29-may-1997 (stial01)
**        - dm0p_uncache_fix: Added additional consistency checks if row locking
**	25-Aug-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Pass log_id to dm0p_toss_pages().
**	05-Feb-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Wait for busy buffer before proceding with the unfix!
**	12-Apr-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    When looking for a MODIFIED page to force, make sure it's not 
**	    also FIXED.
**    28-Feb-2005 (wanfr01,jenjo02)
**          Bug 113547, INGSRV3062
**          Stop doing dirty reads if we are restarting the scan too
**          many times to avoid cpu thrashing.
**	06-Mar-2007 (jonj)
**	    If unfixing during online cluster recovery and page is modified
**	    and should have a cache lock but does not, report the error, crash.
**	15-Jan-2010 (jonj)
**	    SIR 121619 MVCC: DMP_PINFO* replaces DMPP_PAGE**.
**	    Remove any remaining pinfo->pinlock from Root buffer
**	    When unfixing CR page, recursively unfix its Root page unless
**	    DM0P_UNFIX_CR is asserted.

/*
** Name: force_page	- Handle special action on buffer pages.

**	cache the buffer.
**
**	FP_CACHE	Write the buffer if changed, but leave in the
**			cache for future reference. Convert cache lock
**			to IS and mark as CACHED.  Move to free buffer
**			queue.  Take off of transaction queue.
**			This mode is called at end transaction time to
**			force out pages touched during the transaction.
**
**      FP_NULL         Write the buffer if changed, but leave in the
**                      cache for future reference. Convert cache lock
**                      to N and mark as CACHED.  Move to free buffer
**                      queue if not fixed. Take off of transaction queue.
**
**	FP_WRITE	Write the buffer if changed move from modified
**			to free queue if not fixed.  Bump cache lock value
**			if buffer written.
**			This mode is used when the caller does not want
**			to release a page, but wants to guarantee that the
**			page is written.
**
**	FP_TOSS		Place buffer on the free queue
**			after writing the buffer to disk.  Release the
**			cache lock, take off of transaction queue.
**			This mode is used to free a spot in the buffer
**			cache to make room for a new page.

**	FP_DISOWN	Remove the buffer from the transaction queue.
**			This is used for bitmap allocation pages which
**			can be pass around without being written to disk.
**
**	FP_INVALID	Place buffer on the free queue.
**			Bump cache lock value but do not write page.
**			Release cache lock.
**			This mode is used to throw away a page without
**			writing its contents.
**
**	This routine is entered with the buffer manager mutex being
**	held.  If this routine has to write a page to disk, the mutex is
**	dropped during the write and regained before returning.
**
**	The caller must pass in the TCB to the table if an I/O operation
**	is required.  The caller may pass in a null pointer if it can
**	be sure no I/O is required.  There will be no I/O if the operation
**	if FP_INVALID or if the page is not modified.
**
**	The return codes are:
**
**	E_DB_OK: all well.  The buffer mutex is released UNLESS the
**		buffer was marked BUF_RECLAIM, in which case it's still held.
**
**	E_DB_INFO: A very specific error case that leaves the buffer
**		invalidated and the buf_mutex NOT held.  This only happens
**		if:  the buffer holds a temp table page, the caller is trying
**		to RECLAIM it, the caller is not the owner of the temp table,
**		and we get a DISK FULL error writing the page.
**		The reason for a special INFO status is that in the reclaim
**		case, the caller is expecting us to hold the buf mutex,
**		and that's impossible (indeed, the caller has to try again
**		with a different buffer now).
**
**	E_DB_WARN: The force operation needs to be retried for some reason,
**		e.g. the buffer was busy.  The buf mutex is held.
**
**	E_DB_ERROR: The force failed, and we hold the buf mutex.
**
**
** Inputs:
**      buffer                          The buffer to operate on.
**	operation			The operation either:
**					    FP_TOSS - toss page from cache
**					    FP_CACHE - keep page but not owned
**                                          FP_NULL - keep page not owned with
**                                                    null lock.
**					    FP_WRITE - keep page but write
**					    FP_WRITEALONG  - like FP_WRITE
**						but put in free queue at max
**						priority so it stays around.
**					    FP_INVALID - don't write page but
**						invalidate cache lock.
**					    FP_DISOWN - remove from tx queue
**	lock_list			The locking system transaction id.
**	tcb				The TCB for table buffer belongs to.
**					This may be NULL if the buffer requires
**					no IO operations (buffer not modified).
**
** Outputs:
**      err_code                        The reason for the error status.
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK			Successful completion.
**	    E_DB_INFO			Ignorable error, buf invalidated.
**	    E_DB_WARN			Retry operation.
**	    E_DB_ERROR/FATAL		Severe or Fatal error.
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    none
**
** History:
**	18-oct-1985 (derek)
**	    Created new for Jupiter.
**	31-oct-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Changed routine to determine how to manipulate buffer queues
**	    after doing and I/O and Lock work.  This is needed since the
**	    the buffer manager mutex is given up while doing IO and lock
**	    requests, and another thread may change the buffer's status
**	    effecting what should be done with it.
**	31-oct-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Pass page log address to dm0l_force to only force log if it
**	    has not been forced already.
**	 4-dec-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Update free and modify counts when invalidating a modified buffer.
**	28-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for Shared Buffer Manager.
**	    Added tcb parameter.
**	26-jun-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Handle case where bumping out cache-locked pages but don't have a
**	    TCB ptr - took out references to tcb in the xDEBUG and error code.
**	10-jul-1989 (rogerk)
**	    When write out a page, turn off the BUF_EXTENDPAGE status.
**	17-oct-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Merged changes made by Derek during the file extend project.
**	    Added new FP_DISOWN action.
**	    Added trace flags in xDEBUG code.
**	    Added new handling for EOF checking : use tcb_lalloc field.
**	    Took out use of obsolete BUF_EXTENDPAGE.
**	    Added new error message.
**      2-oct-1992 (ed)
**          Use DB_MAXNAME to replace hard coded numbers
**          - also created defines to replace hard coded character strings
**          dependent on DB_MAXNAME
**	3-oct-1992 (bryanp)
**	    We must have a transaction active in order to call dm0l_logforce.
**      07-oct-92 (jnash)
**          6.5 reduced logging project.
**	     -  Insert page checksum.
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced logging project: 
**	      - changed references to tcb fields to use new tcb_table_io 
**		structure fields.
**	      - Added buffer manager transaction context to be used by
**		force_page to force the log file before writing pages.
**	30-October-1992 (rmuth)
**	    - Set tbio_checkeof if trying to force past tcb_alloc.
**	    - For temp tables update tbio_tmp_hw_pageno.
**	14-dec-1992 (jnash & rogerk)
**	    Removed DMPP_ACC_PLV argument from dm2f_write_file.
**	18-jan-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Removed the bypassing of log forces from the recovery process.
**	    Since CLR's are now written during UNDO processing, we must
**	    always make sure that the log file is correctly forced when
**	    forcing pages out of the buffer manager.
**	24-feb-1993 (keving)
**	    => Added changes to allow a buffer manager to work with 
**	    => multiple logs
**	24-may-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Fix an error message parameter (LK_N should have been LK_IS).
**	    If trace point DM302 is set, trace cache lock requests.
**	18-oct-1993 (rmuth)
**	    Add DMP_BMCB statistics.
**	22-feb-1994 (andys)
**	    Integrate recent changes from ingres63p:
**		11-jul-1993 (rogerk & andys)
**		    Update buf_cpcount when force out a page during a
**		    Consistency Point.  This guarantees that the page
**		    will be marked processed by the current CP even if
**		    the page is remodified by a server whose FC thread
**		    has already bypassed the page.
**		 1-nov-1993 (rogerk & andys)
**		    After a buffer has been written, and before
**		    clearing the buffer status by setting it to
**		    BUF_FREE, wake up any threads that are waiting  on
**		    this buffer. [bug 54128]
**		17-nov-1993 (rogerk)
**		    Add check for calling force on a modified page with
**		    a null TCB.  This has been occurring periodically
**		    at CODEX.  The new checks only print out some
**		    additional information, they do not prevent the
**		    ensuing access violation when the tcb is
**		    dereferenced.
**	    Put codex diagnostic inside #ifdef xDEBUG.
**	23-feb-1994 (andys)
**	    Clean up code inside xDEBUG which had not been updated for 1.0
**	18-apr-1994 (jnash)
**	    fsync project.  Eliminate dm2f_force_file() call.
**	06-mar-1995 (harpa06 / abowler)
**          Bug #66815: Imported 6.4 change - Suppress error message reporting 
**          when a page is trying to be forced to a temorary file past EOF when
**          write-behind threads exist.
**      06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Multiple buffer pools in support of variable page sizes.
**	20-mar-1996 (nanpr01)
**	    Added page size as parameter to this routine. To compute
**	    the checksum pagesize is need since sizeof(*page) returns
**	    only the size of physical page.
**      06-may-1996 (nanpr01)
**	    Changed the header access as macro.
**      01-aug-1996 (nanpr01 for ICL phil.p)
**          Introduced another mode, FP_NULL, exclusively used by the
**          Distributed Multi-Cache Management (DMCM) protocol; and a new
**          action NULL_LOCK to cause a ccache lock to be converted to null.
**      01-aug-1996 (nanpr01)
**	    Initialize the err_code to 0 otherwise if the buffer is busy
**	    errors get logged in errlog.log for uninitialized error code.
**	14-Sep-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Caller must hold buffer's buf_mutex.
**	26-sep-1996 (nanpr01)
**	    BTree corruption problem. It is possible for consistency points
**	    to write a fixed page however if we do so we cannot drop the 
**	    cache lock to NULL.. We just write the page out.
**	14-Mar-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Reinstated lbm_lxid_mutex, used in those cases in which an lx_id
**	    isn't passed to this function to single-thread the use of 
**	    the BM's default lx_id.
**	08-apr-1997 (nanpr01)
**	    Corrected Gather write dm2f_write_list parameter list.
**	02-oct-1998 (somsa01)
**	    Pass on the log_id to complete_f_p().
**	08-Jun-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Moved update of temptable tbio_tmp_hw_pageno to complete_f_p(),
**	    til after the write completes instead of before. GatherWrite may
**	    not yet have written the page and we can't allow gfault_page()
** 	    to think the page exists until it does.
**	29-Jun-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Added gw_queued, a pointer to this thread's count of
**	    pages queued for gather write, which is dynamically maintained 
**	    by DI.
**	09-Apr-2001 (jenjo02)
**	    Changed dm2f_write_list() prototype to include pointers
**	    to GatherWrite stats collectors, bs_gw_pages, bs_gw_io.
**	25-Mar-2004 (wanfr01)
**	    Bug 111353, INGSRV 2613
**          force_page should leave with buffer mutexes held, do not release
**          the mutex if you hit E_DM920E
**      29-Sep-2004 (fanch01)
**          Add LK_LOCAL flag support as cache names are confined to one node.
**	13-oct-2004 (devjo01)
**	    Do not ever use gather write if downgrading a cache lock to LK_N.
**	3-May-2005 (schka24)
**	    Make the return statuses even MORE complicated, to cater to the
**	    tricky case of hitting temp table disk full (ignoreable error)
**	    on a RECLAIM.  I've never seen this happen in the wild, but ...
**	29-Apr-2008 (jonj)
**	    Fix to harpa06's fix for bug 66815 - set status = E_DB_ERROR,
**	    clean up checking status along the way.
**	20-Feb-2009 (thaju02)
**	    Supress reporting E_DM93A9 for rollforward. (B121673)

/*
** Name: gforce_page	- Handle special action on group force of buffer pages.
**
** Description:
**      This routine allows the caller to write a group of pages out.
**
** Inputs:
**	bm				Group's cache
**	group				The group to force.
**	lock_list			lock list
**	log_id				The logging system transaction id.
**	operation			The operation either:
**					    FP_TOSS - toss pages from cache
**					    FP_CACHE - keep pages but not owned
**                                          FP_NULL - keep pages not owned with
**                                                    null lock.
**					    FP_WRITE - keep pages but write
**					    FP_INVALID - don't write pages but
**						invalidate cache lock.
**					    FP_DISOWN - remove pages from tx queue
**
**		Currently only FP_TOSS and FP_WRITE are used, though
**	        the code supports the other operations.
**
** Outputs:
**      err_code                        The reason for the error status.
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK
**	    E_DB_WARN		The group could not be forced for any
**				number of reasons.
**	    E_DB_FATAL
**	Exceptions:
**	    none

**
** History:
**	22-Jan-1987 (ac)
**	    Created for Jupiter.
**	10-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Changed to not bump value locks or force file if no writes
**	    are being done.
**	28-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for Shared Buffer Manager.
**	    Added tcb argument.
**	 4-sep-1989 (rogerk)
**	    While pages are being written or locks released (when bm mutex
**	    is released), mark group buffer as busy so it won't be chosen
**	    for reclaimation by another thread.
**	17-oct-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Merged changes made by Derek during the file extend project.
**	    Added new handling for EOF checking : use tcb_lalloc field.
**	    Added new error message.
**      06-jan-92 (jnash)
**          Add support for > 32 gfault pages, up to DM_GFAULT_MAX_PAGES.
**      07-oct-92 (jnash)
**          6.5 reduced logging project.
**	     -  Insert page checksum.
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced logging project: changed references to tcb fields to
**	    use new tcb_table_io structure fields.
**	30-October-1992 (rmuth)
**	    - Set tcb_checkeof if we are trying to gforce past tbio_lalloc.
**	    - If necessary update tbio_tmp_hw_pageno.
**	14-dec-1992 (jnash)
**	    Fix bug inserting checksum on pages.
**	14-dec-1992 (jnash & rogerk)
**	    Removed DMPP_ACC_PLV argument from dm2f_write_file.
**	18-jan-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Removed the bypassing of log forces from the recovery process.
**	    Since CLR's are now written during UNDO processing, we must
**	    always make sure that the log file is correctly forced when
**	    forcing pages out of the buffer manager.
**	24-may-1993 (bryanp)
**	    If trace point DM302 is set, trace cache locking activity.
**	18-oct-1993 (rmuth)
**	    Add DMP_BMCB statistics.
**	22-feb-1994 (andys)
**	    Integrate recent changes from ingres63p.
**		11-jul-1993 (rogerk & andys)
**		    Update buf_cpcount when force out a page during a
**		    Consistency Point.  This guarantees that the page
**		    will be marked processed by the current CP even if
**		    the page is remodified by a server whose FC thread
**		    has already bypassed the page.
**		 1-nov-1993 (rogerk & andys)
**		    After a buffer has been written, and before
**		    clearing the buffer status by setting it to
**		    BUF_FREE, wake up any threads that are waiting  on
**		    this buffer. [bug 54128]
**	18-apr-1994 (jnash)
**	    fsync project.  Eliminate dm2f_force_file() calls.
**      06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Multiple buffer pools in support of variable page sizes.
**	20-mar-1996 (nanpr01)
**	    Added page size as parameter to this routine. To compute
**	    the checksum pagesize is need since sizeof(*page) returns
**	    only the size of physical page.
**      01-aug-1996 (nanpr01 for ICL phil.p)
**          For the Distributed Multi-Cache Management (DMCM) protocol,
**          when writing a page we do not need to convert the cache lock.
**          It will already be LK_X.
**	    Added the gather write and async io amendments.
**	15-Sep-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Caller must hold group's g_mutex and one of its buffer's mutexes..
**	    Added buffer parm to prototype. Caller must specify
**	    which buffer in the group is currently held with its
**	    buf_mutex locked. This buf_mutex, and the group's mutex,
**	    will be left locked  when we return.
**	07-Nov-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    If group is busy, do nothing but return E_DB_WARN.
**	22-Nov-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    In gforce_page(), when waiting for a busy buffer, make sure that
**	    all buffers in the group have their mutexes released.
**	02-Dec-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Replaced line dropped by previous integration.
**	05-Jan-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Added new event wait type, DM0P_GWAIT_EVENT.
**	    If group is busy, wait for it to become unbusy,
**	    then return a warning.
**	13-Jan-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Update bmcb_last_lsn as soon as we know its new value.
**	13-Mar-1997 (jenjo02)
**	  - Decrement g_modcount by the number of buffers actually written
**	    instead of blindly setting it to zero.
**	  - Watch out for FIXED buffers that may appear in the group and
**	    don't mark them freed. dm0p_cachefix_page() may add fixed
**	    buffers to this group while we are forcing modified pages.
**	08-apr-1997 (nanpr01)
**	    Corrected Gather write dm2f_write_list parameter list.
**	11-Apr-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Instead of relying on BUF_DMCM flag to decide whether to
**	    upgrade a lock to SIX, check buf_lock_mode instead.
**	15-Apr-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Wait for mutexed pages to be released, return warning.
**	    Mutex pages while being forced to prevent modification by 
**	    other threads.
**	28-Aug-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Redid group-busy logic, in general, lock group, set busy status, 
**	    unlock group, then lock buffer.
**	19-Jan-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Remove buffer from table's hash queue when buffer is made free.
**	10-Jun-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Make caller responsible for awakening group waiters upon return
**	    from this function.
**	29-Jun-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Added gw_queued, a pointer to this thread's count of
**	    pages queued for gather write, which is dynamically maintained 
**	    by DI.
**	10-Jan-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Rewrote for group priority queues. Make group forces more like
**	    single-page forces by only tossing the group and its pages 
**	    when requested (operation == FP_TOSS), otherwise write the
**	    modified pages (operation == FP_WRITE), move the group to the 
**	    free queue, but leave the pages cached.
**	14-Jun-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Simplified interface. Caller need only mutex the group before
**	    calling here, not the buffer. This function will be responsible
**	    for fixing and unfixing any needed TBIO, marking the group
**	    "BUSY" and awakening waiters when appropriate.
**	    This function will never wait for an event (dm0p_ewait()),
**	    so *gw_queued is no longer a needed input parameter.
**      18-Sep-2003 (jenjo02) SIR 110923
**          Modified to utilize GatherWrite when available,
**          "complete_f_p()" to eliminate duplicate post-force
**          buffer and page handling.
**	10-Nov-2003 (jenjo02)
**	    Tweak to last change: can't use GatherWrite if group
**	    spans multiple locations.
**	24-Jan-2005 (jenjo02)
**	    bs_gwrites[BMCB_PTYPES] reverted to counting one write
**	    for each actual write I/O.

/*{
** Name: dm0p_close_page	- Write pages to disk so file can be closed.
**
** Description:
**	This routine is used to flush pages for a specified table from the
**	cache - generally so that the table can then be physically closed.
**	All modified pages belonging to the table will be forced to disk.
**
**	It may also be used by routines which require the table's modifications
**	to be reflected in the physical database so that read operations can
**	be done which bypass the Buffer Manager - Smart Disk hardware for
**	example.
**
**	Mode DM0P_CLCACHE:
**
**	   If the action DM0P_CLCACHE is specified, then the pages
**	   associated with the table are left in the cache after being
**	   written.  The next time the table is opened, we must verify
**	   that the cached pages are still valid.
**
**	   This routine does not require that the caller guarantee any
**	   exclusive access to the table being forced.  It waits for
**	   any mutexed pages and leaves fixed pages in their fixed
**	   state.  Although since this mode is used in conjunction with
**	   tossing TCB's it is believed to be impossible to find any
**	   fixed or mutexed pages unless a shared cache is in use.
**
**	Mode DM0P_CLFORCE:
**
**	   If the action DM0P_CLFORCE is specified, then the pages
**	   associated with the table are written even if currently
**	   fixed by other threads.  (They will not, however, be written
**	   if mutexed).  The pages are left in the cache after being
**	   written.  This mode is used to prepare for a Smart Disk scan
**	   which operation bypasses the cache but needs to work on the
**	   most up-to-date page copies.
**
**	   This routine does not require that the caller guarantee any
**	   exclusive access to the table being forced. It waits for any
**	   mutexed pages and leaves fixed pages in their fixed state.
**	   Since it can be called at any time, it is expected that
**	   fixed and/or mutexed pages may be found.
**
**	Mode DM0P_CLOSE:
**
**	   If the action DM0P_CLOSE is specified, then all pages
**	   associated with the table are tossed from the cache.
**
**	   This mode is used when a table purge operation is done
**	   requiring all pages associated with the old version of the
**	   table to be written and tossed.
**
**	   It is assumed that the caller holds both an exclusive table
**	   lock and an exclusive table control lock.  No pages
**	   belonging to the table should be fixed in the cache and only
**	   background cache threads can have pages temporarily
**	   mutexed.
**
**	Mode 0:
**
**	   If no action is specified (0), then modified pages for this
**	   table are not written, they are just tossed from the cache.
**	   This should only be used with temporary tables (or tables
**	   that the caller can be sure have no fastcommit changes left
**	   around in the buffer manager).
**
**	   It is assumed that since the table being affected is
**	   temporary that its access is restricted to the calling
**	   session. No pages belonging to the table should be fixed in
**	   the cache and only background cache threads can have pages
**	   temporarily mutexed.
**
**	This routine may be called for one of three reasons:
**
**	    A)	The table is being physically closed by the server as
**		part of a database close, or to make room for another
**		table to be opened.
**
**		In this case all dirty pages must be forced to disk
**		since we cannot guarantee after releasing the TCB that
**		we will later be able to write the pages.
**
**		Generally, the caller will specify the DM0P_CLCACHE action
**		since the table may later be re-opened and we may benefit
**		by leaving them cached.
**
**	    B)	An operation which will invalidate all cached pages for
**		the table is about to occur.  This may be a modify/patch
**		or some other operation which will bypass the buffer manager.
**
**		The operation will usually be followed by a physical close
**		of the table (dm2t_close) since the TCB will probably be
**		invalidated as well.
**
**		In this case we must toss all pages from the cache so that
**		we do not attempt to reuse them later.  The caller should
**		specify the DM0P_CLOSE action.
**
**	    C)	An operation is going to be requested which will read pages
**		while bypassing the buffer manager.  This could be a Smart
**		Disk scan or a Verify operation.
**
**		In this case we must force all modified pages to disk so
**		the cache-bypassing operation can see the correct data.
**		The operation may leave unmodified pages in the cache.
**
**
**	If called with a base table TCB, this routine will act on all pages
**	belonging to secondary indexes as well as the base table.  If called
**	with a secondary index TCB, the routine will act only on pages
**	belonging to that specific secondary index.
**
**	Note that due to multi-server protocols, the table specified may
**	be open and in use by a thread of another server using this same
**	buffer manager.  This routine does not prevent another server from
**	reading in or modifying a page after we have acted on it.  For this
**	reason, this routine cannot guarantee by itself that on return there
**	will be no (modified) pages for the table left in the cache.
**
**	If the caller requires (as in cases B, C above) that no (modified)
**	pages be left on return, then the caller must request an exclusive
**	table lock prior to the dm0p_close_page call.
**
**	If the caller is merely closing the table (case A) then the caller
**	needs only guarantee that there can be no modified pages left if
**	no other server has an open TCB for the table.  This will be
**	guaranteed.
**
**	Any pages that are currently fixed or in use by another server are
**	skipped by this routine.
**
**	In order to give better concurrency, the buffer manager is searched
**	without the buffer manager mutex.  When a page to force is encountered,
**	the semaphore is requested and the buffer must then be checked again to
**	make sure that it still references the same page.
**
**
** Inputs:
**      tcb		The TCB describing table for which pages are forced:

**	action		Either:

**
** History:
**	15-oct-1985 (derek)
**          Created new for Jupiter.
**	28-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for Shared Buffer Manager.
**	    Added DM0P_CLCACHE action.
**	    Added tcb parameter to force_page calls.
**	12-sep-90 (jonb)
**	    Integrated ingres6301 change 280141 (rogerk):
**            Validate buffers before tossing using this TCB - if this tcb
**            is invalid (the table has been modified by a different server
**            since building it), then we don't want to write out any pages
**            from the new file (read in by a different server) to our old
**            version of the table.
**	3-may-1991 (bryanp)
**	    Make dmd_checks more useful by logging detailed error information
**	    before calling dmd_check.
**	17-oct-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Made routine work on secondary indexes.  Previously this routine
**	    could only be called on base table tcb's - and an effect of the
**	    routine was to toss pages for the secondary indexes as well.
**	    If some well-meaning piece of code accidentally called this
**	    routine with a 2nd index TCB, the server would usually dmd_check.
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced logging project: changed references to tcb fields to
**	    use new tcb_table_io structure fields.
**	19-oct-1992 (kwatts) change from 6.4 line: 18-nov-91 (kwatts)
**	    Added DM0P_CLFORCE action.
**	17-dec-1992 (rogerk & jnash)
**	    Allowed routine to toss pages for secondary indexes even if
**	    the secondary index tcb cannot be found.  It is possible
**	    for index pages to be brought into the cache and to be left
**	    there after tossing the index tcb.  If we then rollback the
**	    creation of the index, we will be left with cached pages (which
**	    cannot be modified) that can have no TCB ever associated with
**	    them.  If we then build a tcb for the base table and try to
**	    do a close_page, we will find the old 2nd index pages.  We must
**	    be able to toss them even though we cannot build a tcb for them.
**	16-feb-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Fixed shared cache partial TCB problem.  If close_page is called 
**	    with a partial TCB we must verify that the pages found can be
**	    accessed through the TCB before trying to call force_page.  We
**	    must also skip secondary index pages when the passed in partial
**	    TCB does not have a link to an appropriate index tcb.
**	26-mar-1993 (kwatts)
**	    Action DM0P_CLFORCE was forcing out fixed pages
**	    onto the free chain. Changed the option to force_page() to
**	    WRITE so that pages simply get written in this instance.
**	22-feb-1994 (andys)
**	    Integrate recent changes from ingres63p.
**		 3-may-1993 (andys)
**		    If page is MUTEX'ed, wait for it to be free, mark
**		    it MUTEX'ed, then write it out and mark it
**		    unMUTEXed.  Part of fixes for bug 46951.
**		11-jun-1993 (andys)
**		    Changed routine to write out all modified pages in
**		    the table, even if the pages are currently fixed.
**		    We now check for page_stat dirty bits as well as in
**		    the buffer header and to wait for mutexed pages to
**		    become free (and set MUTEX bit while writing).
**		    These are necessary to satisfy multi-server CP
**		    protocols.  When a TCB is tossed during a CP, we
**		    must make sure that all modified pages are flushed
**		    (and marked as processed by the CP) or else we risk
**		    having all servers CP threads skipping the same
**		    page due to not having a valid TCB at the time they
**		    encounter it.  Delete consistency check which
**		    checked for pages being unexpectedly fixed when
**		    close-page was called.  Don't turn off BUF_FCBUSY
**		    when we process a page - leave that up to the
**		    module which turned it on.
**		17-nov-1993 (rogerk)
**		    Added checks for encountering fixed pages during
**		    various close_page operations.  The last change to
**		    this routine was to allow fixed pages to be
**		    processed during close calls with the expectation
**		    that fixed pages were only possible in CLFORCE or
**		    CLCACHE actions.  Recent errors lead to the belief
**		    that fixed pages are resident during other
**		    close_page actions.  Added back consistency checks
**		    to detect the conditions and changed to call
**		    force_page only in DM0P_WRITE mode when acting on a
**		    fixed page.
**		 7-dec-1993 (rogerk)
**		    If a page has I/O in progress, then wait for the
**		    I/O to complete.  If we don't do this, then garbage
**		    in a page being read in can cause us to erroneously
**		    mark the buffer as modified. If the page was being
**		    read in with READLOCK=NOLOCK then after the buffer
**		    has been copied the page would be put on the free
**		    queue.  Having a buffer marked modified on the free
**		    queue would eventually result in an access
**		    violation in force_page(). [bug 55150]
**	    Make one diagnostic for the AVIS bug #ifdef xDEBUG,
**	    take out another (stashing of force_page return value).
**	    Use tbio_cache_valid_stamp instead of buf_tcb_stamp.
**  	    Change round arguments to force_page (grr).
**      06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Multiple buffer pools in support of variable page sizes.
**      06-may-1996 (nanpr01)
**          Change the reference to the page header with macros for
**	    New Page Format.
**	06-May-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    When checking the page modified bit, use the page size
**	    in the buffer, not the one from the tbio. The TCB at
**	    this point is that of the base table; if an index is
**	    of a different size, this tbio won't work!
**	25-Aug-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Added log_id to prototype, passing it to force_page().
**	15-Jan-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Rewrote to find TCB's pages using the (new) table hash
**	    queue instead of a page-by-page search of every buffer 
**	    in every cache. The hash queue is a list of all BUF_VALID
**	    pages belonging to a table (TCB), including index pages, in
**	    all caches.
**	08-Jan-2002 (jenjo02)
**	    Must force GatherWrite pages if wait for BUF_MUTEX
**	    required.
**	14-Jan-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    Check db_tab_index > 0 for index, not simply != 0.
**	26-Jan-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    Check Master TCB's index list.
**	01-Mar-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    Use Partition's TBIO when forcing a Partition page.
**	01-Apr-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    If partition's Master TCB has no pp_array, can't
**	    get TBIO. This can happen during rollfoward and
**	    is, uh, ok.
**	24-Aug-2005 (jenjo02)
**	    In multi-server, partitioned table, watch for
**	    closed Partition TCB on this server, but buffer 
**	    faulted by another server.
**	06-Jun-2007 (jonj)
**	    Display DM9C01 info in errlog.log in case no iidbms.log.
**	04-Apr-2008 (jonj)
**	    Be very careful about leaving DMCM pages in cache
**	    when there is no underlying GLC. We can't get in the
**	    situation where a DMCM callback fires on a modified
**	    page in a server that has closed its TCB.
**	29-Apr-2008 (jonj)
**	    More tweaks to ensure that cached DMCM pages whose
**	    cache lock is held by this server are tossed from
**	    cache now, before the TCB is vaporized.
**	14-May-2008 (jonj)
**	    CLFORCE action allows FIXED pages, don't DM9C01.
**	02-Sep-2008 (jonj)

/*{
** Name: validate_page	- Validate the cached version of a page.
**
** Description:
**      This routine manages shared pages between multiple servers.  The
**	shared pages are cached in each server when no transaction in
**	the server has locks on the pages.  The pages are locked in null mode
**	while they are cached.  When the lock is converted from null to share
**	or exclusive, the value stored with the lock is checked to see if
**	this version of the page is the most recent.  If not, the page is
**	read from the disk and the version number updated from the lock
**	value.
**
**	The buffer manager semephore must be held by the caller of this routine.
**	This mutex will be released in order to do locking and I/O and will
**	be reacquired before returning, unless there's an error.  An error
**	causes the page to be invalidated and an error returned.
**
**	Upon return: buf mutex held if OK, released if error.
**
** Inputs:
**	rcb				Rcb for lock list.
**      buffer                          The buffer to be validated.
**	action				Fix Page options:
**					    DM0P_READNOLOCK - page is being
**						read with no page lock.
**	lock_list			The lock_list to use.
**	log_id				The log_id to use.
**
** Outputs:
**      err_code                        Reason for error return status.
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK
**	    E_DB_ERROR
**	    E_DB_FATAL
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    The buffer is marked busy while being validated.
**
** History:
**	10-jun-1986 (Derek)
**          Created for Jupiter.
**	 6-dec-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Dont turn off BUF_CACHED bit as the page may not actually be fixed.
**	28-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for Shared Buffer Manager.
**	    Took buf_newvalue field out of DM0P_BUFFER.  Use stack variable
**	    to request lock value.
**	3-may-1991 (bryanp)
**	    Make dmd_checks more useful by logging detailed error information
**	    before calling dmd_check.
**	17-oct-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Merged changes made by Derek during the file extend project.
**	    Added handling for BUF_PAWRITE type buffers.  These need to
**	    go through multi-cache protocols (write at commit/unfix, validate
**	    when fix) during pass-abort operations (when the RCP is acting
**	    on the database).
**	    Added trace flags in xDEBUG code.
**	    Added new session statistics collecting.
**	 3-nov-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Added fixes for File Extend recovery.
**	    Added buffer status PAUNFIX which allows us to tell whether the
**	    WUNFIX condition of a buffer is because of the type of buffer or
**	    because a pass-abort operation is in progress.  This tells us
**	    whether we can reset the WUNFIX status after the pass-abort is
**	    complete.
**	21-jan-1992 (jnash)
**	    Remove PAWRITE validate code.  Modified technique to address
**	    PAWRITE pages simply tosses them at unfix during Pass Abort, 
**	    eliminating need for cache validation.
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced logging project: changed references to tcb fields to
**	    use new tcb_table_io structure fields.  Added action field in
**	    which to pass readnolock state.
**	07-oct-1992 (jnash)
**	    6.5 Reduced logging project:
**	     -  Validate the page checksum.
**	24-may-1993 (bryanp)
**	    If trace point DM302 is set, trace cache locking activity.
**	18-oct-1993 (rmuth)
**	    Add DMP_BMCB statistics.
**      06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Multiple buffer pools in support of variable page sizes.
**	20-mar-1996 (nanpr01)
**	    Added page size as parameter to this routine. To compute
**	    the checksum pagesize is need since sizeof(*page) returns
**	    only the size of physical page.
**      06-may-1996 (nanpr01)
**          Change the reference to the page header with macros for
**	    New Page Format. 
**      01-aug-1996 (nanpr01 for ICL phil.p)
**          Introduced support for the Distributed Multi-Cache Management
**          (DMCM) procotol.
**          Under this procotol, pages are retained in the cache at the end
**          of a transaction. This is effectively providing fast commit in
**          a multi-cache environment.
**          When, on a call to dm0p_cachefix_page, a page is found in the
**          cache, then the following occurs :-
**          If the page is locked at NULL, then it must be validated.
**          If the page is locked at S/X (this is only done under DMCM)
**          then it must already be valid. If the new requested lock mode  
**          is higher than the old mode, it will be converted.
**          NB. Interface changed to include the access_mode parameter,
**              to enable us to decide whether or not we need to convert
**              the existing cache lock.
**	01-aug-1996 (nanpr01)
**	    Change the lock_mode to b->buf_lock_mode to log the granted
**	    lock mode of the cache lock.
**	    Cache-Deadlock Problem : If we ask for a shared cache lock but
**	    get it in higher mode, it is possible that the logical locks
**	    are held at a lower mode consequently allowing the server to fix
**	    the page and causing cache deadlock.
**	    Solution :
**	    1. Force the page out and reacquire the cache lock at given mode.
**	    This is waht is currently implemented.
**	    2. Convert the logical lock to higher mode ie in sync with cache

**	29-aug-1996 (nanpr01)
**	    Try to reclaim locks if lock manager is out of locks before
**	    giving up.
**	14-Sep-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Caller must hold buffer's buf_mutex.
**	14-Mar-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Changed protocol to pass log_id so that it can be passed
**	    to force_page().
**	16-Apr-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    count a bs_check only if we validated the page.
**	    Keep buf_lock_mode in sync with most recent lock mode.
**	01-feb-1999 (nanpr01 & jenjo02)
**	    We must downgrade the cache lock after forcing the page to disk
**	    and reacquire the cache lock in the required mode to avoid
**	    cache deadlock for every pages not just secondary index pages.
**	05-Feb-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    If we have a strong enough DMCM cache lock, don't force the page.
**	    dm0p_dmcm_callback() changed to force fixed-for-read pages if

**	    Only unmutex and mark buffer busy if LK or I/O is needed.
**	05-jan-2005 (devjo01)
**	    Refresh LVB when page refreshed from disk to avoid spurious
**	    E_DM9C91_BM_LSN_MISMATCH errors.
**	28-Feb-2007 (jonj)
**	    Translate DM0P_NOLKSTALL action to LK_NOSTALL for cache locks.
**	27-Sep-2007 (jonj)
**	    If DMCM with shared cache, always make the lock request to

**	17-Oct-2007 (jonj)
**	    Rescind 27-Sep-2007 change, as it apparently sometimes leads
**	    to SV_PAGE lock waits during recovery if lock request

**	15-Nov-2007 (jonj)
**	    If LK_NOTHELD returned from lock request, cached page is no

** History:
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**          Created for Reduced Logging Project.  Code moved here from old
**	    dm0p_fix_page routine.
**	22-nov-1993 (jnash)
**	    Dump lockstat info on page or table escalation deadlock and 
**	    if RCP or if DM304 set. 
**	30-may-1996 (pchang)
**	    Move the display of the E_DM9041_LK_ESCALATE_TABLE message to
**	    dm0p_fix_page() so that it only gets logged if lock escalation is
**	    really going to happen.
**      12-dec-1996 (cohmi01)
**          Add more info to lock timeout/deadlock msgs (Bug 79763).
**      22-nov-96 (dilma04)
**          Row Locking Project:
**          Support for LK_PH_PAGE lock requests
**          Call dm0p_unlock_page with lock_type paramater
**      07-may-97 (dilma04)
**          Bug 81895. If LK returns LK_COV_LOCK treat this lock as a new one.
**      14-may-97 (dilma04)
**          Cursor Stability Project:
**          - added *lock_id argument;
**          - if LKrequest() returns LK_LOG_LOCK, treat this lock as a new one;
**          - call dm0p_unlock_page with lock_id paramater;
**	23-Jun-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Added (optional) lock_value parm to prototype, used to lock/unlock
**	    FHDR/FMAPs.
**	    Make "new_lock" optional - not all callers care.
**	28-May-1999 (nanpr01)
**	    SIR 91157 : Added LK_QUIET_TOO_MANY flag to stop logging 
**	    DMA00D message.
**	11-Oct-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Test locally for security to avoid dma_write_audit() calls.
**	20-Aug-2002 (jenjo02)
**	    Support TIMEOUT=NOWAIT, new LK_UBUSY status from LKrequest().
**	    Write E_DM9066_LOCK_BUSY info message if DMZ_SES_MACRO(35).
**	    Return E_DM006B_NOWAIT_LOCK_BUSY.
**	12-Feb-2003 (jenjo02)
**	    Delete DM006B, return E_DM004D_LOCK_TIMER_EXPIRED instead.
**  	29-Sep-2004 (fanch01)
**          Conditionally add LK_LOCAL flag if database/table is confined

** Name: dm0p_escalate	- Escalate a table to table level locking.
**
** Description:
**      This routine escalates the table whose access context is passed
**	from page level locking to table level locking.  In the process
**	of escalating this table, all tables in the same transaction for
**	the same table are also escalated.  The resulting table level lock
**	mode will be either LK_S if initial lock mode was LK_IS, and
**	LK_X if initial lock mode was LK_IX or LK_SIX.  If table cannot
**	be escalated because of deadlock or timeout a error is returned.
**
** Inputs:
**      rcb				The record control block.
**
** Outputs:
**      err_code                        The reason for the error status.
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK
**	    E_DB_ERROR
**	    E_DB_FATAL
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    none
**
** History:
**	22-oct-1985 (derek)
**          Created new for Jupiter.
**      17-jul-90 (mikem)
**          bug #30833 - lost force aborts
**          LKrequest has been changed to return a new error status
**          (LK_INTR_GRANT) when a lock has been granted at the same time as
**          an interrupt arrives (the interrupt that caused the problem was
**          a FORCE ABORT).   Callers of LKrequest which can be interrupted
**          must deal with this new error return and take the appropriate
**          action.  Appropriate action includes signaling the interrupt
**          up to SCF, and possibly releasing the lock that was granted.
**	    In the case of escalate() go ahead and delete all the page locks,
**	    and return with the interrupt status.  The calling routines will
**	    delete the granted lock as part of normal xaction semantics.
**	17-dec-90 (jas)
**	    Smart Disk change:  renamed to dm0p_escalate and made public
**	    (non-static).
**	27-nov-92 (robf)
**	    Escalations are security events, make sure they are audited.
**	24-may-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Improve error message logging when lock escalation fails.
**	1-jul-93 (robf)
**	    Pass table security label to security audit routines
**	12-aug-93 (robf)
**	    Lock escalations now RESOURCE events rather than TABLE
**	    events.
**	22-nov-1993 (jnash)
**	    Add DM304 to trace lock info on table escalation deadlock,
**	    performed unconditionally if rcp.
**      12-dec-1996 (cohmi01)
**          Add more info to lock timeout msgs (Bug 79763).
**      22-nov-96 (dilma04)
**          Row Locking Project:
**          If escalate when row-level locking, release all the row,
**          value and LK_PH_PAGE locks held by the transaction.
**      06-jan-97 (dilma04)
**          Fix bug 79817. Request to release row locking specific locks 
**          (row, value and LK_PH_PAGE) should be made unconditionally even if  
**          locking granularity of a cursor causing escalation is page level. 
**	26-feb-97 (dilma04)
**	    Extended error handling to cover problems with releasing row,
**	    value and LK_PH_PAGE locks.
**      21-may-97 (stial01)
**          dm0p_escalate: Remove release of LK_PH_PAGE locks.
**      07-jul-98 (stial01)
**          dm0p_escalate: After we escalate, scan RCB's for this 
**          transaction with same base TCB or same TCB. (B63389)
**      07-jul-98 (stial01)
**          B92086 re-init CSRR fields for all RCBs, not just the one that
**          caused the escalation. (or we will get E_CL1039_LK_RELEASE_BAD_PARAM
**          errors trying to release locks that were released during escalation.
**      22-sep-98 (stial01)
**          dm0p_escalate() Added flags parameter, check for escalate LK_NOWAIT
**      02-feb-98 (stial01)
**          dm0p_escalate() Check for LK_BUSY 
**	20-Aug-2002 (jenjo02)
**	    Support TIMEOUT=NOWAIT, new LK_UBUSY status from LKrequest().
**	    Write E_DM9066_LOCK_BUSY info message if DMZ_SES_MACRO(35).
**	    Return E_DM006B_NOWAIT_LOCK_BUSY.
**	12-Feb-2003 (jenjo02)
**	    Delete DM006B, return E_DM004D_LOCK_TIMER_EXPIRED instead.
**      29-Sep-2004 (fanch01)
**          Conditionally add LK_LOCAL flag if database/table is confined
**	    to one node.
**      15-dec-2006 (huazh01)
**          Mark the DMP_RCB for replicator's secondary index to table

**	04-Mar-2010 (jonj)
**	    LK_TABLE locks are always physical locks. Unless LK_PHYSICAL
**	    is asserted here, the lock will be implicitly converted to
**	    a logical lock. As a logical lock, it'll endure for the
**	    life of the transaction, and attempts by dm2t to
**	    release it when the table is closed will be futile,
**	    encouraging future deadlocks.

** Description:

**	by this transaction are taken off of the transaction list.
**
**	If pages must be forced prior to commit (Non Fast Commit) then dirty
**	pages are written to disk.
**
**	If Database is opened with Fast Commit protocol, then dirty pages do
**	not need to be forced prior to the commit, but they still need to be
**	taken off the transaction queue.
**
**	When called with the DM0P_FORCE option, then modified pages are
**	written even if Fast Commit is in use.
**
**	When called with the DM0P_TOSS option, then all pages owned by this
**	transaction are tossed (and written if modified).
**
**	Unmodified pages are also released but never need to be written.

**
** History:
**	15-oct-1985 (derek)
**          Created new for Jupiter.
**	22-Jan-1987 (ac)
**	    Added code for readahead support.
**	31-jun-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Added action parameter for fast commit.
**	31-aug-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Return correct status if encounter warning.
**	28-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for Shared Buffer Manager.
**	    Look up tcb for force_page to use.
**      11-sep-1990 (jonb)  
**	    Integrate ingres6301 change 280136 (rogerk):
**            Pass buf_tcb_stamp value to dm2t_get_tcb_ptr.
**	3-may-1991 (bryanp)
**	    Make dmd_checks more useful by logging detailed error information
**	    before calling dmd_check.
**	    Call dbg_dm9301 before dmd_checking with E_DM9301.
**	9-mar-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Temporary table pages are not forced, merely disowned.
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced logging project: 
**	      - changed references to tcb fields to use new tcb_table_io 
**		structure fields.  
**	      - Changed from old dm2t_get_tcb_ptr to new fix_tableio_ptr.
**	      - Added check to bypass group operations with partial tcb's.
**	      - Added checks to see if buffer must be forced BEFORE looking
**		up the table descriptor (for efficiency).
**	      - Added TOSS option to allow this routine to be called during
**		in place of old dm0p_tran_invalidate.
**	23-aug-1993 (rachael)
**	    Restart at the beginning of the transaction queue when force_page
**	    returns  E_DB_WARN.
**	    When a page is updated by a transaction, it is placed on
**	    that transaction's page queue, meaning it is owned by that
**	    transaction.  This makes it easy to find all pages touched
**	    by a transaction.  There is an array of hash buckets (64)
**	    used to ease locating a particular transaction's page queue;
**	    more than one transaction can hash to the same bucket.
**
**	    At the end of a transaction, pages in the cache owned by the
**	    transaction are taken off the transaction list.  In a non-fast
**	    commit server, dirty pages are written to disk; in a fast-commit
**	    server they need not be written to disk but still need to 
**	    be taken off the transaction queue. The routine that
**	    performs this work is dm0p\dm0p_force_pages.
**
**	    dm0p\dm0p_force_pages computes the hash bucket for this
**	    transaction, takes the buffer manager mutex and walks the
**	    transaction page queue looking for all pages belonging to
**	    this transaction.  When one is found, dm0p\force_page is
**	    called to write the page to disk. Dm0p\force_page checks
**	    to see if the buffer is busy. The buffer is busy if it is
**	    being written out by another thread, e.g., write-behind
**	    thread, fast commit thread, or if it is being written to
**	    disk to make room so another page can be read in.
**
**	    If the buffer is found to be busy, the buffer manager
**	    mutex is dropped, dm0p\force_page waits for the other
**	    session to finish, then retakes the buffer_mutex and
**	    returns to dm0p\dm0p_force_pages with status set to
**	    E_DB_WARN.  This is where the the problem occurs -- since
**	    the buffer manager mutex was released, the ordering of
**	    the transaction list may have been altered and we should
**	    start back at the beginning of transaction bucket.
**	    However, we skipped this step and reprocessed the same
**	    buffer, following its now stale pointer to what had been
**	    the next page in the queue.  This lead to following the
**	    wrong chain of pages and skipping over the pages
**	    belonging to our transaction.
**
**	    Since the buffer manager mutex had been dropped, we need to restart
**	    our search at the beginning of the transaction list.
**	22-feb-1994 (andys)
**	    Integrate recent changes from ingres63p:
**		17-jan-1994 (andys)
**	    	    Add diagnostics for bug 55079.
**	    	    Trace point dm429 will check if transaction queue is looped.
**	    	    Trace point dm430 will dump BM if dm429 finds a loop.
**	    Note that 6.4's trace point dm428 becomes dm430 in 6.5
**      06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Multiple buffer pools in support of variable page sizes.
**      01-aug-1996 (nanpr01 for ICL itb)
**	    Added the gather write and async io amendments.
**	14-Mar-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Moved reloading of tran_chain from queue head to after the mutex
**	    is taken (after call to txnq_delete()).
**      21-may-1997 (stial01)
**          dm0p_force_pages() Skip any buffers with IX lock on the xn queue
**	28-Aug-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Redid group-busy logic, in general, lock group, set busy status, 
**	    unlock group, then lock buffer.
**	10-Dec-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Keep reusing the TBIO as long as possible instead of unfixing it
**	    after every force. Search hash chain using SHARE semaphore.
**	26-Jan-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Refined txn queue search. Do it without taking the chain mutex.
**	10-Jan-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed use of gforce_page(). This was bad as it tossed all
**	    the group pages from the cache, including pages which don't
**	    belong to the transaction which is ending! Instead use
**	    force_page(); it will do the right thing and leave even
**	    group pages cached.
**	12-Mar-2003 (jenjo02)
**	    Release buf_mutex before calling unfix_tableio_ptr(),
**	    retry buffer to avoid rare E_CL2517_CS_SMPR_DEADLOCK
**	    error in fault_page() (B109819).
**	19-Sep-2006 (jonj)
**	    Select only buffers matching log_id + tran_id.
**	    Shared transactions will have the same tran_id but 
**	    different log_id's and we sometimes want
**	    only those buffers belonging to a specific 
**	    log_id/tran_id pair, specifically during 
**	    LOGFULL_COMMIT involving shared transactions.
**      25-Jul-2008 (jenjo02/thaju02)
**          Take mutex before scanning txnq. (B116464)
**	1-Sep-2008 (kibro01) b120843
**	    Mark if the database is in recovery so we can ignore an UNDO
**	    error of a new page which doesn't exist in the physical file.
**	11-May-2009 (jenjo02/thaju02)
**	    In determining if correct tbio, check valid stamp. (B118454)

/*{
** Name: invalidate_page - Invalidate a page in buffer manager
**
** Description:
**      This routine will purge the page described by the arguments from the

**
**	The buffer contents are discarded and the buffer is placed on the
**	free queue.  If this is a member of a group buffer, then
**	the group is shuffled to keep it on the correct group queue (fixed,
**	modified, or empty).
**
**	Note that if the page is in a group buffer, and invalidating it makes
**	the group empty, it (the group) is immediately liable to being grabbed
**	and used as soon as the group mutex is released.  Holding the buf
**	mutex isn't going to stop gfault_page!  Therefore, there's nothing
**	more that a caller can validly do to the buffer once we're done with
**	it (at least not in the general case), so we'll release the buf
**	mutex before returning.
**
**	Enter holding buffer's buf_mutex, return with it released.

** History:

**	28-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for Shared Buffer Manager.
**	30-oct-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Modified routine to better handle buffers that are in various
**	    states - fixed/modified/free/group.  Ignore modified parameter
**	    and check buffer status field.  Fixed bug that invalidation of
**	    fixed pages was not working.
**	22-feb-1994 (andys)

**       	1-nov-1993 (rogerk & andys)
**          	    When we mark the buffer status as BUF_FREE make sure we wake

**      06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Multiple buffer pools in support of variable page sizes.
**	25-mar-96 (nick)
**	    Wake up any threads waiting on IO or FC for this buffer.
**	14-Sep-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Caller must hold buffer's buf_mutex.
**	13-Feb-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Corrected 22-feb-1994 and 25-mar-96 corrections to wake up waiting
**	    threads. Assignments of the form
**	              bool  result = (b->buf_sts & FLAG);
**	    produce correct results if and only if FLAG 
**	    is in the low-order byte of the status word; in all other cases
**	    the result will be zero. The compiler treats this
**	    as a simple assignment and casts b->buf_sts to a byte.
**	19-Jan-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Remove buffer from table's hash queue when buffer is made free.
**	27-Oct-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    When tossing a page from the cache, invalidate its page number by
**	    setting it to -1.
**	28-Oct-1999 (nanpr01)
**	    Fixed X-integration. The fields referenced are not there in 
**	    Ingres II 2.5.
**	10-Jan-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    If tossing a valid group page, decrement group's g_valcount.
**	2-May-2005 (schka24)
**	    Finish buffer manipulations before move-group, as the latter might
**	    make the group free (and grabbable).  Remove unused param.

**          Multiple buffer pools in support of variable page sizes.
**	14-Sep-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Caller must hold group's g_mutex.
**	24-Oct-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Changed prototype to just pass pointer to the group.
**	16-Apr-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Added code to move free group to fixed queue so that
**	    it can be consolidated in one place.
**	    Also added code to move group from modified to fixed
**	    queue when appropriate.
**	    Use logical AND and NOT to set g_sts instead of EQUAL
**	    to avoid destruction of other meaningful status bits.
**	10-Jan-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Implemented group priority queues.
**	14-Jun-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Must wait for busy group before modifying its
**	    attributes and/or changing its state queue.
**	22-Sep-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Added g_lock_list to DM0P_GROUP, lock list of thread that
**	    set G_BUSY state. move_group() won't wait for busy group
**	    if the lock list matches.
**	27-Apr-2005 (jenjo02/schka24)
**	    Pass group count deltas, so that we don't mess with group
**	    counters until after we busy-wait.

/*{
** Name: dm0p_cp_flush - flush all dirty pages in buffer manager.
**
** Description:
**	This routine is called by the fast commit thread (dmc_fast_commit)
**	to flush all dirty pages out of the cache as part of consitency
**	point protocol.
**
**	It cycles once through the buffer manager's buffer cache forcing
**	any dirty page belonging to a fast commit database.  If a page
**	currently busy, this routine waits for it to become not busy and
**	checks again.
**
**	When running in a Shared Buffer manager configuration, there will
**	be multiple fast commit threads (one per server) running at one
**	time.  Because each server may not have an open TCB for every
**	modified buffer in the cache, some buffers may not be able to be
**	flushed by this server.  Whenever a modified buffer is encountered,
**	this routine will look up the tcb for that table.  If there is not
**	a tcb, then the buffer is skipped - we are trusting that it will
**	be processed by another fast commit thread.
**
**	In order to assure that we don't skip any buffers during the CP,
**	we keep an index pointer (bm_cpindex) that is incremented as the
**	fast commit threads cycle through the cache.  This index is set to
**	zero at the start of the consistency point.  Each time the buffer
**	pointed to by cpindex is processed (written or verified that it does
**	not need to be written), the cpindex is incremented.  When all FC
**	threads are done cycling through the cache, the cpindex pointer
**	should point to the last buffer of the cache.  If it doesn't then
**	the CP was not done properly.
**
**	Each time a Fast Commit thread processes a buffer (either writes it
**	or verifies that it does not need to be written), it sets the cpcount
**	field on the buffer to the current bm_cpcount value.  This value is
**	incremented each time a CP is done.  This marks that this buffer has
**	been processed for the current consistency point, and all other fast
**	commit threads can skip over it.
**
**	NOTE: This routine may force a page to disk that is currently FIXED
**	    by another thread!!!!!!
**	The page is mutexed while it is being forced to prevent another
**	thread from updating it while it is being written.
**
**	If a page was fixed for write before the start of this routine, but
**	is not yet dirty, then this routine assumes that the page may be
**	updated by a operation that has been logged previous to the
**	consistency point (which means the change must be forced as part
**	of the CP protocol), and marks the buffer as needing to be forced
**	at commit time.
**
**	This routine currently does all writes using single buffers and
**	does not take advantage of group writes.
**
**	If there are any write behind threads enabled, then start them up
**	in order to flush the buffer manager faster.
**
** Inputs:
**	lock_list	- transaction lock list
**	log_id		- transaction log id
**
** Outputs:
**      err_code                        Reason for error return status.
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK
**	    E_DB_FATAL
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    none
**
** History:
**	15-jun-1987 (rogerk)
**	    Written for Road Runner.
**	30-sep-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Added write behind thread support.  Signal the write behind threads
**	    to assist in the flush.
**	28-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for Shared Buffer Manager.
**	    Skip buffers being written by another fast commit thread.  Skip
**	    buffers that we don't have tcb for.  Use cpcount, cpindex.  Check
**	    for incomplete cp.
**	19-mar-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Fixed semaphore unlock problem.
**	 7-jun-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Don't flush temp tables during CP.
**	10-jul-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Don't flush newly-extended pages during CP.  Those pages must
**	    be flushed by the thread which allocated them.
**	21-aug-1989 (rogerk)
**	    When skipping newly-extended page during a CP, be sure to
**	    increment cpindex if it is appropriate.
**	24-aug-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Moved code for above fix down so that correct cpcount value would
**	    be put into buffer header.
**	 5-sep-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Don't increment IOWAIT and MWAIT statistics when have to wait in
**	    CP flush.  We don't really care when the FC thread has to wait and
**	    it skews the statistics so that we can't tell if user threads are
**	    being forced to wait (which is what we really care about).
**      11-sep-1990 (jonb)
**	    Integrate ingres6301 change 280136 (rogerk):
**            Pass buf_tcb_stamp value to dm2t_get_tcb_ptr.  Added new 
**            informative error message before incomplete_cp server crash.
**	11-sep-1990 (jonb)
**	    Integrate ingres6301 change 280141 (rogerk):
**            Took out 2 args from E_DM9397_INCOMPLETE_CP error message as
**            ER does not seem to support > 10 arguments.
**	17-oct-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Merged changes made by Derek during the file extend project.
**	    Took out use of obsolete BUF_EXTENDPAGE.  Fast commit thread
**	    no longer has to worry about flushing a page which has not
**	    yet had its space allocated in the corresponding file.
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced logging project: 
**	      - Changed to force pages for all database, even those which
**		do not use fast commit.  New recovery algorithms require
**		all dirty pages to be forced at Consistency Points.
**	      - Took out setting of FORCE_COMMIT flag.  It is obsolete now
**		that mutexes are held while logging updates to cached pages.
**	      - changed references to tcb fields to use new tcb_table_io 
**		structure fields.  
**	      - Changed from old dm2t_get_tcb_ptr to new fix_tableio_ptr.
**	15-mar-1993 (jnash & rogerk)
**	    Fix AV in multi-server shared cache CP's.  Don't reference through
**	    null pointer when find a buffer for which this server has no tcb.
**      26-apr-1993 (bryanp)
**          6.5 Cluster support:
**              Replace all uses of DM_LOG_ADDR with LG_LA or LG_LSN.
**	21-may-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Changed routine to not probe the page_stat to check for the
**	    DMPP_MODIFY bit unless the page is currently fixed.  Using the
**	    assumption that the page cannot be modified unless it is fixed,
**	    we avoid referencing pages that have been sitting in the cache
**	    unfixed and unmodified.  This allows CP's to be executed on
**	    large caches without faulting in the entire cache contents.
**      21-jun-1993 (jnash)
**          Add trace point DM1308 to extend length of CP to 30 seconds.
**	18-oct-1993 (rmuth)
**	    Add DMP_BMCB statistics.
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Changed routine to not start up write-behind threads to
**	    assist in flushing the cache to keep cache contention down
**	    during CP events.
**	22-feb-1994 (andys)
**	    Integrate recent changes from ingres63p:
**	 	3-may-1993 (andys)
**   	    	    If we can't find the TCB, then move up the cpindex if 
**		    appropriate. Part of fixes for bug 46951.
**		11-jun-1993 (andys)
**	    	    Add TRdisplay in section of code that "can't happen".
**	    Update to use BUF_MUTEX_OK bit instead of the FCBUSY bit to
**	    indicate that the buffer is mutexed while not fixed.  The FCBUSY
**	    bit now only indicates to the CP threads that another CP thread
**	    is handling that buffer.
**      06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Multiple buffer pools in support of variable page sizes.
**      06-may-1996 (nanpr01)
**          Change the reference to the page header with macros for
**	    New Page Format.
**	01-aug-1996 (nanpr01)
**	    Buffer manager mutex getting released twice. Additionally
** 	    code by itb ie, calling complete_cp_flush will cause 2 call
**	    to eventrelease.
**	13-Feb-1997 (jenjo02)
**	  - After forcing the log, update BM's bmcb_last_lsn.
**	  - Rearranged mutex taking/releasing to enhance cooperation with
**	    other threads.
**	01-May-1997 (jenjo02)
**	  - Rather than waiting for a BUSY or MUTEXed buffer, mark that spot
**	    and go on to find useful work. Iteratively return to those buffers
**	    until all skipped buffers have been processed for this CP.
**	  - Force only those pages which must be included in this CP.
**	    Previously, all modified buffers encountered were written, even
**	    those which were modified after the CP's LSN was established, causing
**	    the CP thread to act as a write-behind thread and extending the
**	    time needed to take the CP.
**	06-May-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Rescinded LSN check outlined above. It's possible for a page to
**	    be modified (LSN1 ), have this CP start (CP LSN), and have the
**	    page be modified again (LSN2). If LSN2 > CP LSN, the page won't
**	    get written.
**     14-oct-1998 (nicph02)
**          CP flush fails with error E_DM9397 although ALL buffers were 
**          flushed out (bug 92677).
**     24-nov-1998 (nicph02)
**        If call to fix_tableio_ptr fails (no TCB found), do not log
**        an error as another CP thread will find the TCB and flush it.
**        (bug 83999).
**	10-Dec-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Keep reusing the TBIO as long as possible instead of unfixing it
**	    after every force.
**	26-Mar-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Avoid TCB/TBIO lookup for temporary tables (which we won't flush 
**	    anyway) by setting BUF_TEMPTABLE in the buffer's status field when
**	    the page is faulted in.
**	20-Jul-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    If the modified and fixed buffer counts are, or are reduced to, zero,
**	    skip the remainder of the cache - there are no buffers which need
**	    flushing.
**	04-Mar-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Test for no TCBs in cache sooner, when cache is first realized.
**	15-Apr-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed all that "skip and return to busy buffer" code, which never
**	    proved effective and probably extended the time to complete a CP
**	    of very large caches. 
**	15-Apr-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed left-over debugging spin loop if CP fails, will now 
**	    procede to dmd_check().
**	06-May-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    CP now prebuilds a list of candidate pages instead of bashing thru
**	    all caches. New function cp_prep() prepares the list for the CP,
**	    cp_flush() drains the queue.
**	09-Mar-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Unfix any tbio before waiting for BUF_MUTEX to avoid undetectable 
**	    deadlock with the thread that holds the MUTEX.
**	23-May-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    CP flush failures may occur if a cache's TCBs have
**	    all been closed/purged by the time the CP thread sees them.
**	    Relocate test for open TCBs after buffer has been 
**	    cp-checked. This is a partial cross integration of 445937 from 3.0.
**	25-Aug-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Whoops, that last change left the buffer's mutex locked.
**	15-Mar-2006 (jenjo02)
**	    Moved dm0l_force to cp_prep so that it's done just
**	    once per CP, not once for each CP thread.

** Name: cp_sort -  Perform Quicksort of a CP array.
**
** Description:
**	Sorts an unordered CP array into

**	in preparation for CP flush.
**
**	The FCB pointer serves as an abstraction of
**	the page within table and accounts for
**	multiple locations.
**
**	Note that the FCB cannot be dereferenced, serving
**	only as a inexact sort key; the FCB may be an
**	address within a different address space (server)
**	and may be in the process of changing as the
**	buffers in the CP array are being concurrently
**	used and altered while this CP is processing it.
**	
**	Because of the dirty-reference situation, this is an approximate
**	sort, not an exact one.  It's good enough to get the buffers into
**	reasonable order to minimize FD stealing, seek repositioning,
**	and maximize the chances that gather-write can be effective.
**
**	Credit for the code goes to 
**	"Handbook of Algorithms and Data Structures", by
**	Gaston H. Gonnet & Ricardo Baeza-Yates.
**	Revised along the lines of Knuth/Sedgewick, ACM Comp Surveys,
**	Dec '74, part two of example 8a.
**
** Inputs:
**	i4 	 *cp_array[]	The current partition of the
**				cp array to be sorted.
**	i4	 *lo		The low bound of the partition
**	i4	 *hi		The high bound of the partition

** History:
**	19-Apr-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Written, extracted from dm0p_cp_flush().
**	12-Jul-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Modified to traverse CP array of BIDs instead of list.
**	24-Aug-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Added "cp_thread" input parm, TRUE if caller is genuine CP
**	    thread, FALSE if not (write_behind). 
**	11-Oct-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Only set BUF_MUTEX on BUF_FIXED buffers to prevent unneeded
**	    mutex waits.
**	    If synch writes are occuring, abandon GatherWrite to minimize the
**	    times the buffers are in a busy state.
**	10-Jan-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Check for temptable pages and ignore them. We made this check
**	    in cp_prep(), but the page by now may have been recycled and
**	    belongs to a temptable.
**	20-Apr-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    If WriteBehind, work array from back-to-front; if CP
**	    thread, work array from front-to-back.
**	14-Jun-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    If skipping a no-longer-modified buffer, be sure to
**	    set buf_cpcount to the current CP value.
**	21-May-2001 (jenjo02)
**	    Don't wait for BUF_BUSY buffers - they will be marked
**	    processed for the CP by force_page or fault_page.
**	16-Jul-2002 (jenjo02)
**	    Incomplete CP errors can occur in multiple server installations
**	    if one server's CP thread falls behind the cpindex.
**	31-Jan-2003 (jenjo02)
**	    Rewrote algorithms for Cache Flush Agent concepts.
**	12-Mar-2003 (jenjo02)
**	    Release buf_mutex before calling unfix_tableio_ptr(),
**	    retry buffer to avoid rare E_CL2517_CS_SMPR_DEADLOCK
**	    error in fault_page() (B109819).
**	11-May-2009 (jenjo02/thaju02)
**	    In determining if correct tbio, check valid stamp. (B118454)
**      06-Nov-2009 (horda03) Bug 122849
**          In an Internal threaded server, if the TCB is "BUSY"
**          allow other threads to run. The thread which flagged the
**          TCB as busy is more than likely a lower priority thread,
**          so need to use a schedulling policy that allows that thread
**          to be scheduled.
**	21-Jan-2010 (jonj) Bug 123165
**	    When spawning agent threads, don't rely on lbm_stats->bs_cfa_active
**	    to terminate the while loop, rather use a local variable. Evidenced
**	    by looping forever because the agent starts (bs_cfa_active++) and 
**	    terminates (bs_cfa_active--) before the next iteration of the
**	    "while" is scheduled.

** Name: dm0p_wbflush_wait - wait for write behind event
**
** Description:
**	This routine goes into a wait state, waiting for the write-behind
**	event to be signaled.  It is intended to be called only from a
**	primary write behind thread.
**
**	The method of waiting for the WB event is to call LKevent using
**	the buffer manager id and the cache number to specify this
**	particular event. When the buffer manager sees that the 
**	writebehind start level has been reached in a cache, LKevent
**	will be called to signal the write behind event.
**
**	At server shutdown time, all dbms task threads are interrupted in
**	order to terminate them.  When this occurs, the LKevent call in
**	this routine (the method by which the routine waits for the WB event)
**	will return with an interrupt status.  This routine will return with
**	E_DB_WARN, signifying that the thread should terminate.
**
** Inputs:
**	cache_ix	- cache being serviced by this WB thread
**	lock_list	- transaction lock list.
**
** Outputs:
**      err_code                        Reason for error return status.
**	Returns:

**	    E_DB_WARN	- Session interrupted
**	    E_DB_FATAL

/*{
** Name: dm0p_flush_pages - flush modified pages from buffer cache.
**
** Description:
**	This routine is used to flush modified pages from a buffer cache
**	so that new pages can be read in.
**
**	It is intended to be called from a dedicated write behind thread
**	when the buffer manager reaches its modify limit.  This will keep
**	user threads from having to do synchronous writes in order to make
**	space for new pages.
**
**	This routine continues writing pages from the modify queues until
**	the write behind end level (bm_wbend) is reached.  It starts with
**	low priority pages and then continues upward.  It will also check
**	the free page count to make sure it is above the free page limit.
**	If there are not enough free pages then we will continue flushing
**	pages even if the bm_wbend level has been reached (currently, this
**	routine will write until we have 5% more pages than the free limit).
**
**	Each time a page is written, it returns back to the lowest priority
**	queue in case any new pages have been put there that can be written.
**	Hopefully this should not cause too much extra overhead scanning
**	the priority queues - if the lower priority queues are still empty
**	then it should not cost too much to verify that (one check per 
**	priority).
**
**	If this Buffer Manager is configured to be used by multiple servers
**	(shared memory buffer manager), then some buffers may not be able
**	to be written by every server (a server will not write a buffer for
**	which it does not already have an open TCB).  This routine will look
**	up the TCB for each modified buffer on the servers tcb list.  If there
**	is not a TCB then the buffer will be skipped and we will go on to the
**	next one. A count of open TCBs per cache is maintained in the DMF_SVCB;
**	if there are no open TCBs in this thread's cache, we do nothing.
**	
**
**	Note that if the servers user threads are creating new modified pages
**	faster than the write behind threads can write them out, then this
**	routine may never return - it will just go on writing pages never
**	reaching the bm_wbend limit.
**	
**
** Inputs:
**	lock_list	- transaction lock list.
**	log_id		- transaction log id.
**	cfap		- pointer to Agent's DM0P_CFA
**			  describing the task(s) to perform.
**
** Outputs:
**      err_code                        Reason for error return status.
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK
**	    E_DB_FATAL
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    May spawn additional WriteBehind agents.
**
** History:
**	29-aug-1988 (rogerk)
**	    written.
**	28-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for Shared Buffer Manager.
**	    Look up TCB for buffers to send to force_page - skip buffers for
**	    which we have no TCB.
**      11-sep-1990 (jonb)
**	    Integrate ingres6301 change 280136 (rogerk):
**            Pass buf_tcb_stamp value to dm2t_get_tcb_ptr.
**	24-oct-1991 (jnash)
**	    Initialize priority, caught by LINT
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced logging project: changed references to tcb fields to
**	    use new tcb_table_io structure fields.  Changed from old
**	    dm2t_get_tcb_ptr to new fix_tableio_ptr.
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Changed consistency points to not start use the write behind
**	    threads to assist in flushing the cache.  Changed flush algorithm
**	    to not be sensitive to Consistency Points.
**	19-apr-1995 (cohmi01)
**	    Add support for group buffers to write-behind thread. Criteria
**	    for determining victim takes into account use for sec indexes.
**      08-feb-1996 (stial01)
**          dm0p_flush_pages() Don't look at bm_gmcount unless the buffer 
**          mutex is held, OR expect that the group modify queue may be
**          empty by the time you get the mutex.  
**          We saw a non zero bm_gmcount, got the mutex, by which time the
**          group modify queue was empty and we called gforce_page with
**          an uninitialized value for DM0P_GROUP *g. This resulted in a SEGV
**          in gforce_page(). Note sometimes the session would be hung
**          waiting on LOGIO.
**      06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Multiple buffer pools in support of variable page sizes.
**      01-aug-1996 (nanpr01 for ICL itb)
**	    Added the gather write and async io amendments.
**	01-Oct-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Mutex granularity alterations. Also changed to make one pass
**	    thru caches for both groups and buffers instead of one pass
**	    for groups and one pass for buffers.
**	12-Feb-1997 (jenjo02)
**	  - Don't force buffers which might induce a log force unless we come
**	    up short during the first complete pass thru the modified queues.
**	  - Don't force groups that might induce a log force if we're able
**	    to force other group(s).
**	  - Use SHARE mutex when scanning group and modified queues.
**	03-Apr-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Skip over fixed priority buffers during the first pass thru
**	    the modified queues.
**	    Keep rescanning the priority queues as long as there are buffers
**	    to flush, as evidenced by modify/free counts. Previously, we'd
**	    bail out after a single pass thru the priority queues even if the
**	    counts hadn't been satisfied.
**	01-May-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Let fixed priority buffers be flushed - after all, they'll just
**	    be written, not tossed.
**	21-Aug-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    In dm0p_flush_pages(), lock buffer before locking group to adhere
**	    to mutex protocol and avoid deadlocks.
**	28-Aug-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Redid group-busy logic, in general, lock group, set busy status, 
**	    unlock group, then lock buffer.
**	10-Dec-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Keep reusing the TBIO as long as possible instead of unfixing it
**	    after every force.
**	20-May-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Dynamic, cache-specific WriteBehind thread rewrite.
**	29-Oct-1998 (schte01)
**	    Moved # to column 1 to avoid compiler errors on axp_osf.
**	03-Mar-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Don't stick around just for CP flush if this cache has already
**	    been flushed for the CP.
**	15-Apr-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    If entire cache has passed and nothing was found to flush,
**	    give up to avoid futile looping while attempting to aid a CP.
**	29-Jun-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Employ GatherWrite when available.
**	11-Oct-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    If synch writes are occuring, terminate GatherWrite to minimize the
**	    time buffers are in a busy state.
**	10-Jan-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Implement group priority queues. Call gforce_page with
**	    FP_WRITE to write the group pages but keep the pages in cache
**	    instead of tossing them.
**	    After writing a buffer, instead of always returning to 
**	    the priority zero queue, find the lowest priority queue on
**	    which newly modified pages have appeared, otherwise stay
**	    at the same priority. Before returning to a lower priority
**	    queue, force any GatherWrite buffers which have accumulated.
**	    This induces I/O completion on those buffers and causes them
**	    to be moved from the modified to free queues, reducing the
**	    clutter we have to pass over when rescanning the lower
**	    queues.
**	20-Apr-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    If nothing else to do and a CP flush is in progress in
**	    this cache, participate.
**	21-mar-2001 (devjo01)
**	    When using INTERNAL threads, server could hang if all group
**	    buffers had busy TCB's.  Fixed 'all_group_tcbs_busy' logic
**	    to avoid this (b104299).
**	08-Jan-2002 (jenjo02)
**	    Alternate between flushing single-page buffers and groups
**	    so that the concentration on one does not starve the
**	    server of the other.
**	31-Jan-2003 (jenjo02)
**	    Rewrote algorithms for Cache Flush Agent concepts.
**	12-Mar-2003 (jenjo02)
**	    Release buf_mutex before calling unfix_tableio_ptr(),
**	    retry buffer to avoid rare E_CL2517_CS_SMPR_DEADLOCK
**	    error in fault_page() (B109819).
**      28-Feb-2005 (wanfr01,jenjo02)
**          Bug 113547, INGSRV3062
**          Stop doing dirty reads if we are restarting the scan too
**          many times to avoid cpu thrashing.
**	11-May-2009 (jenjo02/thaju02)
**	    In determining if correct tbio, check valid stamp. (B118454)

    ** Cache Flush Agents:
    **
    ** The "Primary" WriteBehind "thread" (started when the server
    ** comes up and persisting the life of the server) is now
    ** termed the Primary Agent. It comes to life in a cache when
    ** one of the following events occur:
    **
    ** 		o The single-buffer modified count reaches or exceeds
    **		  bm->bm_wbstart
    **		o The group-buffer modified count reaches or exceeds
    **		  bm->bm_gwbstart
    **		o A Consistency Point has found modified pages in
    **		  the cache that need flushing.
    **
    ** While performing any of these initial "tasks", any of the 
    ** other events may occur and be added to the work to be done
    ** by an Agent. Consistency Point events take precedence over
    ** WriteBehind events.
    **
    ** "Cloned" Agents are spawned as needed to assist with the
    ** tasks by overlapping I/O with other Agents. 
    **
    ** The number of active Agents is maintained algorithmically 
    ** per-cache depending on the task being performed:
    **
    **   o Single-buffer WriteBehind flush
    **	    log2(mcount - wbend - 256)
    **   o Group-buffer WriteBehind flush
    **	    log2(gmcount - gwbend - 32)
    **   o Consistency Point flush
    **	    log2(cpbufs - 256)
    **
    ** In a multi-server configuration, Agents are deployed 
    ** proportionally to each server. There is an upper limit
    ** of 32 Agents per cache per installation.
    **
    ** Each Agent is assigned a cache-unique "id" from 0-31. 
    ** When assisting with a CP flush, this id is used to divide 
    ** the CP array among the Agents.
    **
    ** All Agents persist until all assigned tasks are complete, i.e.,
    ** all CP buffers are flushed and/or the modified counts are
    ** reduced to wbend, at which time the Primary Agent waits for
    ** the next event signal and the Cloned Agents terminate.
    **
    ** A trace point, DM414, is provided to TRdisplay lots of
    ** information about the life and work of the Agents.
    ** The trace point affects all caches in all connected servers.

**	so that new pages can be read in. Unlike the dm0p_flush_pages()
**	function, it is called from the write-along thread of a dedicated
**	IOMASTER server type, and is intended to be less obtrusive than
** 	dm0p_flush_pages.
**
**	See the block comment on dmcwrite.c - dmc_write_along() for
**	more information.
**
**
**	Each time a page is written, it returns back to the lowest priority
**	queue in case any new pages have been put there that can be written.
**	Hopefully this should not cause too much extra overhead scanning
**	the priority queues - if the lower priority queues are still empty
**	then it should not cost too much to verify that (one check per 
**	priority).
**
**	Although the sessions that caused the pages to be dirty are not part
**	of this server, If the database is in the database list given    
**	to the iomaster server at startup, a TCB/TBIO will be opened
**	in this server for use in writting out the pages.
**
** Inputs:
**	lock_list	- transaction lock list.
**	log_id		- transaction log id.
**	duties 		- bitmap of duties this thread must do:
**				DM0P_WA_SINGLE - write single bufs
**				DM0P_WA_SINGLE - write group bufs
**
** Outputs:
**	num_flushes	- Number of flushes done, used by writealong thread
**			  as indication of how busy we were.  
**      err_code                        Reason for error return status.
**
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK
**	    E_DB_FATAL
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    none
**
** History:
**	22-April-1995 (cohmi01)
**	    Adapted from dm0p_flush_pages for use in write_along thread.
**      06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Multiple buffer pools in support of variable page sizes.
**	01-aug-1996 (nanpr01 for itb ICL)
**	    Converted to use gather-write.  After a force_page the table is
**	    unfixed in a completion routine which is executed when the
**	    write actually completes.
**	01-Oct-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Mutex granularity alterations. Also changed to make one pass
**	    thru caches for both groups and buffers instead of one pass
**	    for groups and one pass for buffers.
**	25-Feb-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Use SHARE mutex when scanning group and modified queues.
**	28-Aug-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Redid group-busy logic, in general, lock group, set busy status, 
**	    unlock group, then lock buffer.
**	10-Dec-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Keep reusing the TBIO as long as possible instead of unfixing it
**	    after every force.
**	10-Jan-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Implement group priority queues.
**	12-Mar-2003 (jenjo02)
**	    Release buf_mutex before calling unfix_tableio_ptr(),
**	    retry buffer to avoid rare E_CL2517_CS_SMPR_DEADLOCK
**	    error in fault_page() (B109819).
**    28-Feb-2005 (wanfr01,jenjo02)
**          Bug 113547, INGSRV3062
**          Stop doing dirty reads if we are restarting the scan too
**          many times to avoid cpu thrashing.

**
**	The number of connections is verified by checking the number of

**
**	Since it is possible for a server to exit abnormally without adjusting

**	abnormally during a consistency point, the logging system must restart

** Name: dm0p_toss_pages - toss pages for a database/table from cache
**
** Description:
**	This routine scans through the buffer manager and tosses any pages
**	that belong to the specified database/table.
**
**	It cannot guarantee that upon exit there will be NO pages left
**	in the cache for the specified database/table - only that any
**	left are protected by other servers.
**
**	This routine is called when a server notices that a change may
**	have occurred to a table (or entire database) that may invalidate
**	the information in our cache.  This includes specific DBU operations
**	such as MODIFY (which will change the structure of a table without
**	changing the cache locks on each page of the table) or simply the
**	event of a database open by another server (which may have then
**	changed pages without bumping cache locks).
**
**	Since other servers and/or sessions may be connected to this buffer
**	manager, this routine does not guarantee upon returning that all
**	pages are tossed from the buffer cache.  Pages that are fixed by
**	other threads are not tossed - these are assumed to be valid.  Also
**	as this routine scans through the cache, new pages on the specified
**	table/database may be being faulted in by another session.
**
**	Unless directed otherwise by the 'toss_modified' flag, this routine
**	will skip over modified pages in the cache.  These are assumed to
**	be validated and protected by the server which has modified them.
**
** Inputs:
**	dbid		- database id - 0 for all databases
**	tabid		- table id - 0 for all tables
**	lock_list	- lock list to do LK waits on
**	toss_modified	- whether to toss modified pages as well.

**
** History:

**	    Reduced logging project: changed references to tcb fields to

**	    Check buf_sts before dbid, tabid. We may be called while holding   
**	    a buffer's mutex and don't want to error trying to take that

**	15-Jan-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    When database_id and table are both known, use much faster
**	    table hash queue to find all pages belonging to the table.
**	    The hash queue is a list of all BUF_VALID

/*{
** Name: dm0p_dbcache - register open/close of db with buffer manager
**
** Description:
**	This routine is called whenever a server opens or closes a database.
**	The open call should be made after the database open has been registered
**	with the Logging System and the close call should be made before the
**	close has been registered with the Logging System.  This assures that
**	recovery is done correctly when a server exits abnormally.
**
**	This routine actually serves two puposes:
**	    1) It manages the dbcache list (locks and open counts).
**	    2) It verifes any cached pages on the database.
**
**	The buffer manager keeps a set of database cache entries.  These are
**	used to enable the buffer manager to keep pages cached after the
**	database has been closed.  Each entry has an open-count (the number of
**	servers that have this database open) and a cache lock value.  The
**	cache lock value tells us whether the database has been updated by a
**	different buffer manager (thus making changes without reflecting those
**	changes in our cache).  The open count tells us whether another server
**	already has this db open (thus it has already verified that all cached
**	pages are OK).
**
**	NOTE:  The open count in these enties is not guaranteed to be the
**	    actual count of opens of this database.  It is only guaranteed that
**	    if the count is > 0, some server (1 or more) must have this
**	    database open.  It is possible (through the reclaiming of cache
**	    entries) for the open count of an entry to be zero even though the
**	    database is open by some server.  The only effect of this situation
**	    is that we may toss pages that we could actually have used.
**
**	NOTE:  There is no guarantee that there is a database cache entry for
**	    each open database in the buffer manager.  In fact it is expected
**	    that there will not be.
**
**	Each time a database is opened by a server, this routine is called to
**	check the dbcache entry.  If there not one, or the open count is 0 and
**	the cache lock value is changed, then all pages for this database are
**	tossed from the cache.  If there is no cache entry, then one is
**	created.  The open count for that database is incremented.
**
**	Each time a database is closed, this routine is called to register the
**	close.  The entry for this database is looked up and if found, its open
**	count is decremented.  If there is no entry for this database, then one
**	is created with an open count of zero.  Thus if the database is opened
**	again in the near future, we should have a database cache entry to
**	check.
**
**	Each time a cache entry is referenced, it is moved to the top of the
**	dbcache list.  Each time a new entry is built, the last entry of the
**	list is scavanged to build the new one.
**
**	If we decide to purge the cache, return(E_DB_WARN) so the
**	caller can decide if other stuff tied to the DB needs to
**	be cleaned up as well.
**
**
** Inputs:
**	dbid		- database id
**	open		- TRUE if open, FALSE if close
**	write_mode	- TRUE if open for write
**
** Outputs:
**	err_code	- reason for error status
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK
**	    E_DB_ERROR	- database cache lock could not be aquired
**	    E_DB_WARN	- Database cache was purged.
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	All cached pages for this database may be tossed from cache
**	if value of db cache lock has been changed by another server.
**
** History:
**	 6-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Created for Terminator.
**	10-apr-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Make sure entry is valid before using it.
**	15-may-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Add error code parameter, return LOCK_QUOTA_EXCEEDED if run out
**	    of locks.
**	 4-feb-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Added new argument to dm0p_toss_pages calls.
**	24-may-1993 (bryanp)
**	    If trace point DM302 is set, trace cache locking activity.
**	18-oct-1993 (rachael) merged 25-mar-1993 (bryanp) -- B47950, B50252
**	    If LKrequest() returns LK_VAL_NOTVALID, then we must assume that
**	    cached information for this database is invalid and we must toss all
**	    cached pages.
**	18-oct-1993 (rmuth)
**	    Add DMP_BMCB statistics.
**      06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Multiple buffer pools in support of variable page sizes.
**	13-Jan-2005 (jenjo02)
**	    Return E_DB_WARN if we decide to purge the cache.
**	27-Sep-2007 (jonj)
**	    Clean up mutex handling; it's not nice to hold mutexes
**	    while waiting for locks.
**	04-Apr-2008 (jonj)
**	    Close more holes in list search, lock requests.

/*{
** Name: dm0p_tblcache - register build/modify of table with buffer manager
**
** Description:
**	This routine manages the table cache lock array.  This is used to allow
**	us to close tables (physicallay - ie. TCB thrown away) without tossing
**	all pages belonging to the table from the buffer manager.  This will
**	allow pages to remain in the cache to be used by other servers that
**	still have the table open, or this server the next time it opens the
**	table.  This is also necessary to allow us to save cached information
**	when entire databases are closed.
**
**	This routine is necessary to implement multi-server protocols.  It is
**	not needed if the database is accessable through only one buffer
**	manager at a time.
**
**	Whenever a TCB is built for a table, this routine is called to see if
**	any cached pages for that table are still valid.  If a server using a
**	different buffer manager has modified the table while bypassing the
**	buffer manager page cache locks (any dbu operation), then we must toss
**	all pages for that table from the cache.
**
**	If we have a table cache entry, and the value of its lock is not
**	changed then we know any information in the cache for that table is
**	still valid.  If the lock value has changed, or if we have no cache
**	entry, then dm0p_toss_pages() is called to toss any pages belonging to
**	this table from the cache.
**
**	Whenever a server makes a change to a table that necessitates tossing
**	pages from the cache, it will call this routine with the MODIFY action.
**	This will bump the value of the cache lock - thus when any other buffer
**	manager next opens this table, it will toss all cached pages.
**
**	If the action specified is MODIFY, and we are unable to acquire and
**	bump the cache lock, then this routine will return E_DB_WARN.  In this
**	case the caller should not continue with the table modifying operation
**	as other servers will not see that they must invalidate cached pages
**	for that table.
**
** Inputs:
**	dbid		- database id
**	tabid		- table id
**	action		- cache action:
**			    DM0P_VERIFY - check cache lock to see if cached
**				pages for specified table are still valid.
**			    DM0P_MODIFY - bump cache lock value in order
**				to invalidate cached pages in other servers.
**	lock_list	- lock list to use for waits
**
** Outputs:
**	err_code	- reason for error status
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK
**	    E_DB_WARN	- table cache lock could not be acquired
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	none
**
** History:
**	 6-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Created for Terminator.
**	10-apr-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Make sure entry is valid before using it.
**	15-may-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Add error code parameter, return LOCK_QUOTA_EXCEEDED if run out
**	    of locks.
**	 4-feb-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Added new argument to dm0p_toss_pages call.
**	24-may-1993 (bryanp)
**	    If trace point DM302 is set, trace cache locking activity.
**	18-oct-1993 (rachael) merged 25-mar-1993 (bryanp) -- B47950, B50252
**	    If LKrequest() returns LK_VAL_NOTVALID, then we must assume that
**	    cached information for this table is invalid and we must toss all
**	    cached pages.
**	18-oct-1993 (rmuth)
**	    Add DMP_BMCB statistics.
**	25-Aug-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Added log_id to prototype, passing it to dm0p_toss_pages().
**	27-Sep-2007 (jonj)
**	    Clean up mutex handling; it's not nice to hold mutexes
**	    while waiting for locks.
**	04-Apr-2008 (jonj)
**	    Close more holes in list search, lock requests.

/*{
** Name: dm0p_eset - setup for event wait on buffer manager event
**
** Description:
**	Call LK to set up for event wait call.  Uses cross-process
**	lock event calls.  Should be used only for events signaled
**	in the Buffer Manger routines.
**
**	The lock type and value define the event.  These two arguments
**	should be identical between sessions that are cooperating on
**	the same event.  Since these events are handled accross DBMS
**	servers, the event arguments must be constant accross DBMS
**	processes (which means addresses of structures should not be
**	used as event values).
**
**	In general, the event_value argument should be the unique buffer
**	manager id (bm_id).  This serves to make sure that common events use
**	identical values between servers that are connected to a common buffer
**	manager, but that two servers connected to different buffer managers
**	will not use common event values.
**
**	The event type should be chosen from the list of event type values in
**	DM0P.H.  For event types that specify a set of event objects (such as
**	waits on individual buffers, or groups of structures), the event value
**	is shifted over and a value indicating the individual event object
**	should be added to the event type (for example, when waiting on a busy
**	buffer, the index of the buffer in the buffer array is added to the
**	event type).
**
**	Unless the return_on_error argument is specified, this will
**	dmd_check upon any LK error.
**
**	If the LK call is interrupted (and return_on_error is specified),
**	E_DB_WARN is returned.
**
**	The LK_EVENT is prepared as:
**
**		type_high	DM0P_._EVENT in high-order
**				cache_ix in low-order, if qualified by cache.
**		type_low	buf_index, g_index, 0, depending on event type.
**		value		always bmcb_id.
**
** Inputs:
**	lock_list	- list to do wait on
**	event_type	- The event type.
**	cache_ix	- the cache qualifier
**	event_object	- The object which is being waited on.
**	return_on_error	- if not specified, routine will dmd_check on an
**			  unexpected event.
**
** Outputs:
**	None
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK
**	    E_DB_WARN	- LKevent call interrupted
**	    E_DB_ERROR	- LKevent error
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	Will crash server if error and return_on_error not specified.
**
** History:
**	 6-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Created for Terminator.
**       11-jan-1993 (mikem)
**          su4_us5 port.  Compiler complained about no return at end of
**          function (it doesn't understand that dmd_check() never returns.
**	25-mar-96 (nick)
**	    Added DM0P_FCWAIT_EVENT support.
**	05-Feb-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Added DM0P_GWAIT_EVENT.

** Name: dm0p_pass_abort - Inform BM of transaction PASS_ABORT status.
**
** Description:
**	This routine is called when the server fails for some reason in
**	abort processing and must signal the RCP to do the abort processing.
**
**	If the server does not keep cache locks on the database being
**	recovered (sole_server or sole_cache), then it must take care not
**	to bring into the cache any pages that might be invalidated by
**	the RCP during abort processing.
**
**	Before signaling the RCP to do recovery, the server will toss all
**	cached pages for this database from the cache.  New pages that are
**	faulted in after this are assumed to be OK.
**
**	In most cases, new pages can be brought into the cache without risk,
**	due to page locking algorithms.  Since all pages that the RCP will
**	update must be locked by the transaction (exeption is system catalog
**	pages - and these have cache locks), then normally any thread wishing
**	to reference one of these pages will have to wait until abort processing
**	is complete to read the new page.  The execption is read-nolock and
**	group faults, which read in pages without locks.
**
**	When this routine is called, it will mark the buffer manager status so
**	that group faults will be disallowed, and pages read in with read-nolock
**	will be immediately tossed from the cache.
**
**	Places in the buffer manager which need to check this PASS_ABORT status
**	should do so with the dm0p_recover_state routine.  This routine will
**	be responsible for checking the PASS_ABORT status and checking the
**	installation's recovery progress to determine when to turn off the
**	PASS_ABORT status.
**
**	This routine is called with two modes.  If 'recovery_started' is
**	not set, then a status will be set which indicates that the routine
**	dm0p_recover_state should not reset PASS_ABORT state yet, as the
**	installation's recover status will not yet be set.  This routine
**	should be called again with 'recovery_started' set after the RCP
**	has been signaled to do this abort.  After this is done, then
**	dm0p_recover_state should reset PASS_ABORT status when it sees that
**	the RCP is not doing any work.
**
** Inputs:
**	recovery_started    - indicates whether the RCP has been signaled to
**			      start recovery processing.
**
** Outputs:
**	none
**	Returns:
**	    none
**	Exceptions:
**	    none

** Name: dm0p_recover_state - Check server status for PASS_ABORT.
**
** Description:
**	This routine by the group fault code and readnolock code.  It checks
**	to see whether the server is in a state where non-locked pages should
**	not be brought into the buffer manager.
**
**	When the server signals the RCP to abort a transaction for it, it must
**	set a state in the buffer manager which indicates that non-locked pages
**	must not be read into the cache - they risk being invalidated by the
**	RCP.  This status is the PASS_ABORT status.
**
**	This routine needs only be called if the database is not using cache
**	locking to protect against updates by other processes.
**
**	If the server is in PASS_ABORT state, and the RCP has already been
**	signaled to do the abort (indicated by the absense of the PREPASS_ABORT
**	status), then this routine will check the recovery system (using
**	LGevent) to see if the RCP is finished with recovery processing.  If
**	there is no recovery going on, then this routine will turn off the
**	PASS_ABORT status.
**
**	NOTE: This routine assumes the caller holds the buffer manager mutex.
**
** Inputs:
**	lg_id		- Logging system identifier.
**
** Outputs:
**	none
**	Returns:

**			  should be brought into the buffer manager.
**	    FALSE	- Server is not in PASS_ABORT state.
**
**	Exceptions:

/*{
** Name: dm0p_wpass_abort - write modified pages as part of passabort protocol.
**
** Description:
**	This routine scans through the buffer manager and tosses any pages
**	marked BUF_PAWRITE that belong to the specified database.
**
**	Pages marked BUF_PAWRITE are allowed to be kept in the cache modified
**	even though no transaction locks protect their consistency.
**
**	When a pass-abort is signaled (RCP will recover database while it
**	is in use) - these pages must be tossed from the cache so that the
**	RCP will see valid versions of the pages.
**
**	After being tossed, these pages may be reread, but buffer manager
**	protocols will insure that the pages are written each time they
**	are changed (ie not allowed to remain modified in the cache) while
**	the pass-abort is in progress.
**
**	This routine should always be called AFTER having set the server
**	pass-abort status (BMCB_PASS_ABORT), to make sure that pages which
**	are changed and/or unfixed after this routine has finished will
**	be forced to disk if modified as part of the PAWRITE protocol
**	(which states that a PAWRITE page must be written at unfix time
**	during a pass-abort).
**
** Inputs:
**	dbid		- database id - 0 for all databases
**	lock_list	- lock list to do LK waits on
**
** Outputs:
**	None
**	Returns:
**	    none
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	none
**
** History:
**	17-oct-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Created as part of the 6.4 -> 6.5 merge.  This routine was
**	    written to replace the changes made to dm0p_toss_pages by
**	    the file extend project.
**	21-jan-1992 (jnash)
**	    Modify Pass Abort protocol to set BUF_TUNFIX on pages
**	    passed over because they were fixed or busy.
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced logging project: changed references to tcb fields to
**	    use new tcb_table_io structure fields.  Changed from old
**	    dm2t_get_tcb_ptr to new fix_tableio_ptr.
**	18-oct-1993 (rmuth)
**	    Add DMP_BMCB statistics.
**      06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Multiple buffer pools in support of variable page sizes.
**      01-aug-1996 (nanpr01 for ICL itb)
**	    Added the gather write and async io amendments.
**	25-Aug-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Added log_id to prototype, passing it to force_page().
**	10-Dec-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Keep reusing the TBIO as long as possible instead of unfixing it
**	    after every force.
**	23-Jan-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Rewrote to find pages using table hash queues instead of doing
**	    sequential scan of all caches.
**	12-Mar-2003 (jenjo02)
**	    Release buf_mutex before calling unfix_tableio_ptr(),
**	    retry buffer to avoid rare E_CL2517_CS_SMPR_DEADLOCK
**	    error in fault_page() (B109819).
**	11-May-2009 (jenjo02/thaju02)
**	    In determining if correct tbio, check valid stamp. (B118454)

/*
** Name: dm0p_reparent_pages	- Move a set of pages from one table to another
**
** Description:
**	The new in-memory build facility of DM1X allows a new version of a
**	table to be constructed directly into buffer manager page frames,
**	rather than in a file on disk. This feature is used by in-memory
**	temporary tables.
**
**	The build is done using a "build TCB", which is yet another temporary
**	table which persists only for the duration of the build and exists
**	merely in order to provide an RCB for the build routines to use to
**	fix and unfix pages.
**
**	At the completion of the build, the page frames which have been built
**	containing the new table's pages must be "re-parented" into the
**	ownership of the desired table. After this is done, the build TCB
**	will be thrown away.
**
**	This routine takes all current pages in the buffer manager page
**	frames which are owned by "old_parent" and switches them to have the
**	ownership of "new_parent".
**
**	Currently, this routine only works if both old_parent and new_parent
**	are base tables (not secondary indices). This is sufficient for the
**	current requirements of temporary tables, which don't support secondary
**	indices.
**
** Inputs:
**	old_parent		    table which currently owns the pages
**	new_parent		    table which should be given the pages
**
** Outputs:
**	err_code		    Set appropriately if an error occurs
**
** Returns:
**	E_DB_OK
**	E_DB_ERROR
**
** History:
**	1-may-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Created for the in-memory builds project.
**      06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Multiple buffer pools in support of variable page sizes.
**	15-Jan-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Rewrote to find TCB's pages using the (new) table hash
**	    queue instead of a page-by-page search of every buffer 
**	    in the cache. The hash queue is a list of all pages
**	    belonging to a table (TCB), including index pages, in
**	    all caches.
**	08-Sep-1998 (shero03)
**	    Change the hash algorithm to mod by the hash count.
**	14-Jan-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    Check db_tab_index > 0 for index, not simply != 0.

/*
** Name: fix_tableio_ptr - Get Table IO descriptor for read/write operations
**
** Description:
**	This routine fixes a table io descriptor from the table cache to
**	use for IO operations.
**
**	If a Table Descriptor is found for the specified table, but it is
**	listed as being partially open, then the tbio is checked for access
**	to the desired page.  If the location of the specified page is
**	not open in the table descriptor, then the tbio is not returned.
**
**	If a Table Descriptor is found, it is validated against the current
**	buffer by comparing its cache lock value with the version stored
**	in the cached buffer.  If they do not match, then the tbio is not
**	returned.
**
**	If no Valid Table Descriptor is found which gives access for requested 
**	buffer, a warning is returned, unless DM0P_TBIO_BUILD was specified,
**      in which case the DCB is searched for, and a new TBIO is built
**	if the DCB can be located. This is only done for write_along threads,
**	so they can write pages for tables that of course are not open
**	in this server.
**	
**
**	If the TCB is currently busy, this routine will return a warning
**	unless the DM0P_TBIO_WAIT option is specified (in which case it
**	will wait out the BUSY state).
**
**	If the caller holds the buffer manager mutexed, then it must pass
**	the DM0P_TBIO_MUTEX_HELD flag.  This indicates that the routine should
**	release the mutex while waiting out a BUSY tcb state.
**
**	The fix_tableio_ptr routine is modified by the following options:
**
**	    DM0P_TBIO_WAIT		- Wait for TCB if it is busy
**	    DM0P_TBIO_MUTEX_HELD	- Indicates caller holds BM mutex
**	    DM0P_TBIO_NOPARTIAL		- Indicates that a partially open
**					  table descriptor should never be
**					  returned.
**	    DM0P_TBIO_BUILD		- build tbio if not there already
**          DM0P_NOT_MATERIALIZED       - Don't return table descriptor for
**                                        tables that haven't been materialized yet.
**
** Inputs:
**	b				buffer for which table descriptor needed
**	flags				options to fix request:
**					    DM0P_TBIO_WAIT
**					    DM0P_TBIO_MUTEX_HELD
**					    DM0P_TBIO_NOPARTIAL
**					    DM0P_TBIO_BUILD
**	lock_list			Lock List Id
**	log_id				Log transaction id
**
** Outputs:
**	tableio_ptr			Set to point to fixed tableio cb.
**	err_code			Reason for error return status.
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK
**	    E_DB_ERROR
**
** History:
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**          Created for Reduced Logging Project.
**	15-Sep-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Caller must hold buffer's buf_mutex EXCL, which replaces the
**	    functionality of "bmcb_mutex". The DM0P_TBIO_WAIT now
**	    applies to buf_mutex, having deprecated bmcb_mutex.
**	23-Sep-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    When a BUSY is returned from dm2t_fx_tabio_cb() and DM0P_TBIO_WAIT
**	    DM0P_TBIO_MUTEX_HELD are specified, release the buffer mutex before
**	    calling dm2t_wt_tabio_ptr(), but don't reacquire it before returning
**	    E_DB_WARN. In every case the caller just released the buffer mutex
**	    anyway and went on to retry the buffer.
**      31-aug-2000 (stial01 for jenjo02)
**          ignore E_DM0054 for indexes (B83999)
**	18-May-2007 (kibro01) b118353
**	    Amend fix for b56705 to check for materializing rather than deferred
**	    to avoid fastload locking when trying to fix a page which it itself
**	    has in the cache (i.e. any single-thread using all the cache)
**	14-Jan-2004 (jenjo02)

/*
** Name: dm0p_before_image_check	- Check whether BI is needed.
**
** Description:
**	This routine is called just before a page is modified to determine
**	whether a Before Image needs to be generated for the page before 
**	it is updated.
**
**	The before_image_check must be called anytime a page is modified
**	as part of a DML operation and must be done BEFORE mutexing the
**	page so as to avoid logfull stalling issues.
**
**	Before Images are currently used only for Online Backup processing.
**	Whenever a page is modified while an Online Backup is in progress,
**	a Before Image is logged.  These BI's will be copied to the database
**	Dump file to be used to restore the database to a consistent state
**	at the start of a Rollforward.
**
**	If we recognize that this page has already been logged during the
**	current backup operation, then we need not log a new Before Image.
**	We recognize this by checking the Log Sequence Number of the last
**	update to this page.  If the page has already been updated since the
**	beginning of the checkpoint, then a Before Image of it must have
**	already been logged, so we need not log another.
**
**	(Note that this optimization depends on the fact that we currently
**	do not allow a backup to start while there are transactions in
**	progress on a database.  Without this restriction it would be possible
**	for us to miss logging a needed BI if the backup were started between
**	the call to this routine and the update to the page.)
**
** Inputs:
**	rcb		- Record Control Block for current operation.
**			  Can be used to locate Database Control Block.
**	page		- Pointer to page which might need a Before Image.
**
** Outputs:
**      err_code
**
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK
**	    E_DB_ERROR
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    none
**
** History:
**	17-oct-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Great Merge of DMF : Move 6.4 changes into 6.5.  In this case,
**	    the 6.4 version of this file was moved directly to 6.5 and the
**	    6.5 changes were merged back in:
**
**	    13-mar-1990 (derek)
**		Created from inline DM2R code for Jupiter.
**	17-sep-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging: completely rewrote routine.
**	    The routine used to be used to determine if a Before Image was
**	    needed for a number of different uses, most of them involving
**	    Undo recovery.  It logged BI's for normal DML statements, Free
**	    Space pages during certain operations and Btree Indexes during
**	    Online Backup.  With the 6.5 recovery algorithms, Before Images
**	    are logged only for Online Backup processing.
**	02-jan-1993 (jnash)
**	    Reduced logging.  Add LGreserve call.
**      26-apr-1993 (bryanp)
**          6.5 Cluster support:
**              Replace all uses of DM_LOG_ADDR with LG_LA or LG_LSN.
**		In before_image_check, compare the page_log_addr (which is
**		    actually an LSN) with d->dcb_backup_lsn, rather than
**		    d->dcb_backup_addr.
**	26-jul-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Change generation of Before Image log records during Online Backup.
**	    Instead of calling before_image_check on every dm0p_fixpage 
**	    operation, we now expect the modifier of the page to call 
**	    dm0p_before_image_check before changing its contents.
**	    Made before_image_check external and added dm0p_ prefix.
**	20-sep-1993 (jnash)
**	    Add flag param to LGreserve() calls.
**      06-may-1996 (nanpr01)
**          Changed all page header access as macro for New Page Format.
**      01-may-1996 (stial01)
**          LGreserve adjustments for removal of bi_page from DM0L_BI
**	17-jun-96 (nick)
**	    There is a recovery operation CLR associated with a DM0L_BI
**	    record and hence we MUST reserve log space for this as well.
**	10-jan-1997 (nanpr01)
**	    Put back the space holder for DM0L_BI, DM0L_AI.

** Name: dm0p_check_consistency	- Run consistency checks on the buffer manager.
**
** Description:
**	This routine can be run periodically from buffer manager routines
**	when enabled by trace points (see DM415) to help track down buffer
**	manager consistency bugs.
**
**	It scans through the buffer manager looking for anything that looks
**	to be illegal.  Current stuff that is checked:
**
**	Inconsistencies are reported to the server trace log.
**
**	The following tracepoints alter the termination of this routine:
**
**	    DM416 - dmd_check if any inconsistencies
**	    DM417 - signal the debugger if inconsistencies
**	    DM434 - dump BM on first failure
**
** Inputs:
**	id		identifier of calling routine
**
** Outputs:
**	None
**
** Returns:
**	E_DB_OK		- nothing wrong
**	E_DB_ERROR	- buffer manager inconsistent
**
** History:
**	17-nov-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Created as part of working on codex shared buffer manager problems.
**	28-dec-1993 (andys)
**	    Add timestamps.
**	    If trace point dm427 is set, dump control blocks on first
**	    inconsistency.
**	    After MAX_DM415 TRdisplays, don't do any more checking.
**	22-feb-1994 (andys)
**	    Cast args to dmd_fmt_cb.
**	22-feb-1994 (andys)
**	    Change args to dmd_fmt_cb to fit in with new arguments.
**	18-sep-1995 (nick)
**	    Change DM427 to DM434.  Note that the use of this tracepoint is 
**	    almost but not quite the same as DM430 ( but could probably
**	    be so ).
**      06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Multiple buffer pools in support of variable page sizes.
**	10-Jan-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Implement group priority queues.

** Name: dm0p_page_lock_mode - figure out the page lock mode
**
** Description:
**     Calculates the lock mode required based on locking granularity

**
**
**     Covering page lock (S or X) is required:
**         -  if page-level locking granularity is chosen;
**         -  for special page types (non-leaf Btree index,
**            fhdr, fmap);
**
**     To provide phantom protection, serializable reader should
**     also acquire S lock (or X lock, if readlock == exclusive):
**         -  on a Btree leaf page;
**         -  on a HEAP or ISAM page (except when fetching by tid
**            from base table);
**
**     In all other cases acquire an intended lock (IS or IX) on the
**     page instead of covering lock.
**
**     Exclusive or Shared lock mode depends on the access mode.
**
** Inputs:
**      rcb                             The RCB that wants the page lock.
**      action                          Fix actions used by caller.
**      access_mode                     The page access mode: read or write.

/*
** Name: dm0p_dmcm_callback - callback function for DMCM related lock requests.
**
** Description:
**   Under the DMCM protocol, at the end of a transaction, 'dirty' cached 
**   pages are retained with their original lock; 'clean' pages are retained
**   with a null lock.
**   When another session requires that page, the LKrequestWithCallback 
**   call in dm0p_cachefix_page/fault_page will cause this routine to be 
**   called if a locking contention has occurred.
**   The desired page will either be written and dropped or simply dropped
**   from the cache depending upon what actions were previously performed on
**   it.
** 
**   The complexity of the callback stems from the fact that it can be
**   scheduled to be called at any point after a contending cache lock
**   request occurs. 
**   Secondly, if the cache page is dirty, we have to fix the appropriate
**   TCB, to enable a write to be performed. But to do this, we have to
**   release the buffer manager mutex.
**
**   These two features mean that on executing the callback, we have to
**   ensure that the buffer is still in a state to enable execution. 
**
**   That is,
**   1) The buffer data (page etc.) has not changed.
**   2) The buffer is valid.
**   3) The buffer is locked.
**
**   If any of these three checks fail, there is nothing for the callback
**   to do - except, if necessary, unfix the tcb its just fixed.
**
** Inputs:
**   lock_mode - the mode of lock requested by the caller who is contending with
**               the current cache page lock.
**   ptr       - NOT used.
**   lockid    - the LK identifier of the resource on which the locking
**               contention has occurred.
**
** Outputs:
**   None.
**
** Returns:
**	OK	- page is written out if modified.  Cache lock is converted
**		  downward.
**	E_DB_INFO - page was marked with BUF_RBUSY.  This could be due
**		to either the page being faulted in, or a validate being
**		performed in another session.  Current lock state on this
**		page cannot be reliably determined.   This status indicates
**		that the operation should be tried again after a pause for
**		the BUF_RBUSY to clear.
**	E_DB_WARN - callback was "stale".  Page has either been recycled,
**		or the cache lock has already been downgraded.  Callback
**		can safely be ignored.
**	E_DB_ERROR - Fatal failure of routine.  We actually call dmd_check
**		instead of returning this code, as not handling a callback
**		is fatal to the server.
**
** History:
**      01-aug-1996 (nanpr01 for ICL phil.p)
**        Created.
**	01-aug-1996 (nanpr01)
**	  Put the has_bucket calculation & LKshow call inside the loop.
**	  Reinitialize found inside the loop.
**	  Also initialize the cache_op stack variable accoring to the
**	  dmcm protocol.
**	  Added lock_key parameter in the routine since lockid by itself
**	  can be reused and causes confusion and dmd_check error.
**	19-aug-1996 (nanpr01)
**	    Also it may be likely that the lock has been dropped when 
**	    this routine is called. Also is is possible that the other
**	    server has gotten the lock and this server has requested it
**	    and is waiting for the other server to give up the resource
**	    when this routine is called.
**	    If the buffer belongs to group buffer do no bother. Just call
**	    force_page and it will take care of it.
**	01-Nov-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Altered code to fit with new semaphore scheme.
**	10-Dec-1996 (nanpr01)
**	    Inadvertently dropped code was added back.
**	08-Apr-1997 (jenjo02)
**	  - Use new LK_S_SLOCKQ function to silence LK errors if lockid
**	    can't be found (a "normal" condition).
**	  - If fix_tableio_ptr() returns OK without waiting and releasing
**	    the buffer's mutex, there's no need to rescan and recheck the buffer.
**	  - Check this server's locklist id against that returned by LKshow()
**	    to close a window whereby the lock info matches in every other 
**	    respect.
**	  - If lockid or buffer is stale, return E_DB_WARN so lk_callback()
**	    can track statistics.
**	19-Jan-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Modified to find buffer using (new) table hash chain instead of 
**	    searching buffer hash in every cache.
**	20-aug-2002 (devjo01) b108551
**	    Call force_page with new evcomp value BMCL_DMCM_CBACK from
**	    dm0p_dmcm_callback in order to turn off the BUF_MUTEX & 
**	    BUF_MUTEX_OK bits dm0p_dmcm_callback asserted.
**	24-May-2005 (jenjo02)
**	    Remove lock list id compare when validating LK_S_LOCKQ; the
**	    one returned from LKshow will be the list id on which the
**	    lock resides - in a shared cache environment, this won't be
**	    the same as lbm_lock_list. Instead we rely on the fact that
**	    it's only the BM that makes lock requests for LK_BM_PAGE locks,
**	    hence the list id is of no import.
**	03-Oct-2005 (fanch01)
**	    BUG115322.  Test for buf_lock_mode == LK_N could peek inside a
**	    busy buffer.  This causes locks to incorrectly be ignored and
**	    required callbacks to be dropped which later causes an internal
**	    deadlock.  Simply move the mode test after the busy test.
**	17-oct-2005 (devjo01) b114660
**	    Under highly concurrent cirucumstances in a cluster, it is
**	    possible for a stale callback to see a BUF_RBUSY set by
**	    dm0p_validate.  This would stall the callback thread, and in
**	    the worst case cause a scheduling deadlock where the holder
**	    of the page cache lock on the other node could not release
**	    the fatal page (typically a map page) because a blocking
**	    notification to the stalled callback thread could not be
**	    processed.
**	06-Jun-2007 (jonj)
**	    Add more diagnostic info before dmd_check, make force_page
**	    failures dmd_check also.
**	11-Jan-2008 (jonj)
**	    Add diagnostic if ESET for BUF_MUTEX wait fails.
**	04-Apr-2008 (jonj)
**	    When unfixing tbio, pass DM2T_NORELUPDAT to 
**	    prevent silent deadlock if dm2t(update_rel)
**	    tries to PAGE lock the page whose cache lock we
**	    just down-converted. An "active" session may still
**	    hold the covering PAGE lock.
**	    Do not wait for BUSY TCB; rather return E_DB_INFO to have
**	    the callback rescheduled.

/*
** Name: dmcm_cache_flush - flush cache when closing server running DMCM.
**
** Description:
**
**   	Distributed Multi-Cache Management (DMCM) is effectively Fast_Commit
**   	in a Multi_Cache environment. As cached pages are not written at the
**   	end of a transaction, it is possible for a server's cache to still
**   	contain locked pages (possbily unwritten) when the server is shut
**   	down.
**   	This routine is called by dm0p_deallocate - prior to deallocating
**   	the cache - to flush all the pages still locked.
**   	No fixed, busy, or mutexed pages are expected.
**   	Still-locked pages will be force_page'd with the FP_TOSS flag.
**
** Inputs:
**
** Outputs:
**   None.
**
** Returns:
**   E_DB_OK			Successful completion.
**   E_DB_WARN			Retry operation.
**   E_DB_ERROR
**   E_DB_FATAL			Fatal error.
**
** History:
**      01-aug-1996 (nanpr01 for ICL phil.p)
**          Created.
**          (Actually this is a copy and simplification of dm0p_cp_flush).
**	01-Nov-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Altered code to fit new semaphore scheme.
**	23-Apr-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed buf_pid and references to it. In DMCM, this is a
**	    private cache and can only be locked or referenced by this
**	    server. Fixed, busy, or mutexed pages should never be encountered.
**	    Should this function be exposed to a server crash, this might
**	    have to change.
**	28-Nov-2005 (devjo01)
**	    Enhancements for multi-server multi-cache DMCM.

** Name: dm0p_count_pages
**
** Description:
**   Count the number of dirty pages for the table identified by table_id,

**   Used by the TCB callback routine dm2t_tcb_callback, to ensure that if
**   a TCB is flushed from the cache, no dirty pages for that table are left
**   behind.
**
** Inputs:
**   Database and table identifiers.
**
** Outputs:
**   None.
**
** Returns:
**   Count of number of cached pages for the table concerned.
**
** History:
**      01-aug-1996 (nanpr01 for ICL phil.p)
**          Created.
**      01-aug-1996 (nanpr01)
**	    Loop through all buffers for matching table.
**	01-Nov-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Added mutex protections of buffers.
**	23-Apr-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed check of buf_pid vs server pid, which
**	    is nonsensical in a private cache.
**	21-Jan-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Converted sequential all-cache scan to table hash
**	    list scan.
**	23-Jan-1998 (jenjo02)

**	01-aug-1996 (nanpr01 for anb & itb ICL)
**	    Created
**	    Correct the mutexing; it is assumed that the BM mutex is
**	    held when the routine is entered.
**	01-Nov-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Changed to use buf_mutex instead of obsolete bmcb_mutex.
**	12-Feb-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Delay waking up buffer waiters until we're about to return.
**	    Moved code which updates bmcb_last_lsn to force_page() so that
**	    it can be updated as soon as its new value is known.
**	01-Apr-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Made complete_f_p() the sole keeper of bs_force stat.
**	    Added bs_toss to count pages tossed from cache to make room for another.
**	    Added bs_priforce, bs_pritoss stats to track fixed priority forces.
**	08-May-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed resetting of BUF_LOCKED | BUF_CACHED when unlocking a page.
**	    This wasn't needed and was being done without the protection of
**	    the buffer's mutex.
**	19-May-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    In complete_f_p(), put empty pages at the head of the free queue
**	    so that fault_page() will pick them before valid pages, which are
**	    placed at the end of the free queue.
**	19-Nov-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Do NOT release buf_mutex on I/O error. Caller expects buf_mutex to
**	    be locked!
**	12-Jan-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Wake up waiters on buffer, even if I/O error occurs.
**	19-Jan-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Remove buffer from table's hash queue when buffer is made free.
**	01-oct-1998 (somsa01)
**	    In case of E_DM9448_DM2F_NO_DISK_SPACE and tbio_temporary,
**	    invalidate the page and return an OK status.
**	    (Bug #93633)
**	08-oct-1998 (somsa01)
**	    Corrected last cross-integration; cache_ix is now bm->bm_cache_ix.
**	    Also, invalidate_page() now takes four parameters.
**	01-feb-1999 (nanpr01 & jenjo02)
**	    Check the FIXED status before marking it FREE.
**	07-May-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed gather_flag parm. Buffer mutex semantics are
**	    not changed when gather write is used.
**	    Removed lsn parm, which isn't needed.
**	24-Aug-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    If buffer is marked BUF_RECLAIM, remove it from whatever state
**	    queue it's on, but don't insert it onto a free queue.
**	14-Sep-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Accurately count free buffers.
**	27-Oct-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    When tossing a page from the cache, invalidate its page number by
**	    setting it to -1.
**	10-Jan-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    If tossing group page, decrement group's g_valcount.
**	21-May-2001 (jenjo02)
**	    Added evcomp parm and associated special processing 
**	    culled from old "complete_...()" functions.
**      18-Sep-2003 (jenjo02) SIR 110923
**          Modified to anticipate multiple buffers, as when forcing
**          groups.
**	27-Apr-2005 (schka24/jenjo02)
**	    Don't move-group until we're fully done with the buffer, if there
**	    is any chance that we're emptying the group.  (Which makes the
**	    group grabbable, and gfault-page might start setting up for
**	    reading, unmutexed.)
**	3-May-2005 (schka24)
**	    Fix the fix to bug 93633, SET should have been GET, don't
**	    invalidate if we're the owner.
**	    Also, status handling needed updated for group force.
**	14-Nov-2007 (jonj)
**	    If lock request returns LK_NOTHELD, cache page is no longer
**	    protected by a SV_PAGE lock, toss it from the cache.

/*
** Name: dm0pMakeCRpage
**
** Description:
**
**	Create a buffer/page pair for a Consistent Read image 
**	of a current database page ("root").
**
**	The macro dm0pLockBufForGet has determined that the
**	Root page is inconsistent with the transaction's CRIB
**	and that a consistent read image of the page needs
**	to be made.
**
**	The Root page's buffer is fixed and has been pinned.
**
**	Make a CR image of the page and overlay the caller's
**	Root page pointer with a pointer to the CR page.
**	
**	The page will be made consistent to the
**	point in time described by the
**	transaction's "crib".
**
**	CR buffers are linked to a list from
**	the root buffer (buf_cr_next/prev). Their
**	"point in time" page is read-only and visible
**	to any transaction with the same CR requirements.
**
**	The mutex-deadlock-free way to deal with a Root and CR
**	buffer at the same time is to mutex the Root's buf_mutex,
**	then individually mutex/unmutex the CR. If one must
**	get from a CR buffer to its Root, the CR mutex must
**	be released before attempting to acquire the Root.
**
**	A CR buffer is identified by its
**	buf_cr_root being something other than
**	BUF_ENDLIST - buf_cr_root is the cache index
**	to its Root buffer.
**
**	A CR buffer never appears on the buffer
**	hash queue, but is automatically
**	added to the table's queue when created and 
**	inserted onto the last unfixer's transaction queue.
**
**	CR buffers are subject to the same
**	cache age tossing as any other page; when 
**	tossed, they are removed from root's CR
**	list.
**
**	When fixed, both the CR buffer and
**	root buffer are fixed, but because the CR
**	page cannot be modified it will
**	never appear on the modified queue.
**
**	The DMPP_PAGE pointer to the CR page
**	is returned to the fixer. When unfixed,
**	both the CR buffer and root buffer
**	are unfixed. It is a protocol error to 
**	explicitly unfix a root buffer/page.
**
**	Unlike root buffers, CR buffers will
**	never have BUF_LOCKED | BUF_MODIFIED | BUF_MUTEX
**	status bits set.
**
** Inputs:
**	r			Transaction's RCB
**	pinfo->page		Pointer to pointer to read-inconsistent
**				Root page.
**
** Outputs:
**	pinfo->page		Pointer to Consistent Read buffer
**	pinfo->CRpage
** Returns:
**	E_DB_OK
**	E_DB_ERROR
**
**      Exceptions:
**          none
**
** Side Effects:
**	CR buffer/page may be added to root's CR list.
**
** History:
**	15-Jan-2010 (jonj)
**	    SIR 121619 MVCC: Stubbed in.
**	24-Feb-2010 (jonj)
**	    SIR 121619 MVCC: Watch for now-consistent Root when
**	    restarting big while loop.
**	    Remove test for RCB_CONSTRAINT, now filtered out before
**	    this function is called.
**	26-Feb-2010 (jonj)
**	    CRIB being used now anchored in RCB.
**	02-Apr-2010 (jonj)
**	    SIR 121619 MVCC: Watch for buffers being reclaimed,
**	    report E_DM0028_UNABLE_TO_MAKE_CONSISTENT here so
**	    page, table, database can be made known.

/*
** Name: make_consistent
**
** Description:
**	Apply undo to a CR page to achieve

**
** Inputs:
**	r			Transaction's RCB
**	b			Pointer to CR buffer.
**	pinfo->CRpage		Pointer to copy of root page.
**
** Outputs:
**	None.
** Returns:
**	E_DB_OK
**	E_DB_ERROR		If some unexpected error or could not
**				complete undos.
**
**      Exceptions:
**          none
**
** Side Effects:
**	None
**
** History:
**	15-Jan-2010 (jonj)
**	    SIR 121619 MVCC: Stubbed in.
**	04-Feb-2010 (jonj)
**	    SIR 121619 MVCC: Add bufid parameter to dm0l_read()
**	    to have LGread try to find the log record in the active
**	    log buffers before resorting to looking elsewhere.
**	    dm0l_position() relocated to the only place it's really
**	    needed - just after allocating DMP_LCTX.
**	    When reading from log buffers, the need for this
**	    function to LGforce the log buffers is removed;
**	    LGread will do that as needed.
**	26-Feb-2010 (jonj)
**	    CRIB being used now anchored in RCB.
**	18-Mar-2010 (jonj)
**	    Untangle ReadFromLog, ReadFromJnl initial settings, one or the
**	    other must be TRUE;
**	09-Apr-2010 (jonj)
**	    Check status == E_DB_OK before setting UndoComplete lest we loose
**	    track of, for example, a dmve error.
