		Building and Installing Ingres ® on Linux


  Note: this is a living document; for the latest version please see
  http://www.ingres.com/.

  Introduction
  ------------

  Ingres is renowned for its ease of installation and administration.
  And, as you are about to find out, it can also be compiled quickly and
  easily on Linux with the standard GNU toolset and the Jam build tool
  (an enhanced replacement for Make).  The Ingres product itself is
  advanced, complex, and full featured, and the build process requires
  a very specific build order because of bootstrapping issues (e.g.,
  the esqlc SQL precompiler must be built, and parts of Ingres are in
  turn built with esqlc).  However, the Jam build definitions enable
  a simple (from the programmer's point of view) build process by
  automatically detecting and handling these build prerequisite issues.
  For more information on Jam, see http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html
  and http://freetype.sourceforge.net/jam/. Follow 
  ftp://ftp.perforce.com/jam/ to obtain a copy of Perforce Jam. Version
  2.5 is currently the recommended version

  These instructions describe building Ingres on Linux.  However, the
  same basic techniques are used for building the product on all Unix
  variants, and the same underlying technology (i.e. Jam) is used for
  the Windows and VMS builds as well.  For example, should an adventurous
  individual decide to port Ingres to Apple's Intel version of Mac OS X
  operating system, the same basic techniques would apply.


  Hardware prerequisites
  ----------------------

  Ingres can be built on a modern computer running Linux (e.g. a machine
  with a 2.6GHz processor and 1GB RAM) in less than an hour.  However, it
  is possible to build, install, and run Ingres on less powerful machines.
  Ingres recommends at least a PIII 500Mhz processor (or equivalent) and at
  least 512MB RAM.  Free disk space of at least 2GB is recommended.


  Software prerequisites
  ----------------------

  Ingres has been developed and tested at Ingres Corporation with
  various Linux distributions running the Linux 2.4 & 2.6 kernels and GNU
  GCC versions 3.3.2 and 3.3.3, along with the compatible GNU libraries and
  tools.  Note: problems have been encountered compiling Ingres with GCC
  release 4.0; for the present, please do not use that compiler version.


  Preparing to build
  ------------------

  The compile must be done using an "ingres" user id.  This should be a
  "normal" Linux user (no root privileges are required).  The UID
  (numeric user id), default group, and GID (numeric group id) are not
  significant; ingres can be assigned to group "ingres", "users", etc.
  Please assign this user the bash login shell.

  The build process requires the following tools:

      o gcc and accompanying tools such as ar, ld, flex, etc.
      o g++ development package
      o Jam
      o PAM development package

  Most Linux distributions provide a "developer" logical package that
  includes all the required components except for Jam.  Jam can be
  installed from your Linux distribution's packages, or can be downloaded
  from the websites mentioned above in the Introduction.

  The Ingres build tree should be located in a directory owned by the
  ingres user (/home/ingres is fine).  The root of this build tree is
  known as ING_ROOT, and many build environment variables are assigned
  relative to this setting.  Example: if the ingres_source directory
  is located in the ingres user's home directory, then ING_ROOT is
  /home/ingres/ingres_source.  Most of this environment setup is automated
  by the bldenv script (located in $ING_ROOT/src/tools/port/jam).

  The documentation files README, INSTALL, TESTING, etc. are located in
  ING_ROOT, as are a number of subdirectories used for Ingres building
  and testing:

	ingres_source
	|-- INSTALL	this file
	|-- README	general introduction
	|-- TESTING	acceptance testing directions
	...
	|-- Kerberos5/	Kerberos headers
	|-- build/	output of Ingres build process
	|-- install/	bootstrap partial install for build process
	|-- pax/	special Portable Archive Interchange for Ingres
	|-- release/	staging area for Ingres install media
	|-- src/	Ingres source tree
	|-- tools/	Ingres test tool executables
	|-- tst/	Ingres test tool source and test scripts
	|-- tstinst/	Ingres full installation for acceptance testing
	`-- xerces-c-src_2_5_0/  Xerces C headers and library

  Note:
      o Xerces and Kerberos need not be located in this tree; see below
	for details. Some of the directories are created during the 
	build process. 
      o The pax source is only required to be built on Linux


  Build configuration
  -------------------

  The building of Ingres is conditional upon many environmental factors
  (e.g. does the operating system support IEEE floats? what is the
  bit length of an integer? are POSIX threads supported?).  Most of
  these settings are already configured in the Ingres code base (using
  platform conditional #ifdef expressions) or are automatically detected
  by the build process.  A few settings, especially in a file called
  $ING_ROOT/src/tools/port/conf/VERS, can be set by the programmer who is
  building Ingres to control product options and identification.  The VERS
  file provided in this source tree can be used as-is.  However, should
  you build modified versions of the source code, you should change the
  "build=" setting in VERS so that the product identification (visible
  in various signon and log messages) clearly distinguishes the version
  that your user is running.

  For example, a setting of "build=42" in VERS would yield a message
  like this:

  $ sql iidbdb
  INGRES TERMINAL MONITOR Copyright 2009 Ingres Corporation
  Ingres Linux Version II 9.3.0 (int.lnx/42) login
  Mon Feb 09 18:25:44 2009


  Ingres facilities (in 150 words or less)
  ----------------------------------------

  The Ingres source tree is grouped by major component, further subdivided
  by Ingres facility.  You do not need to know this to compile Ingres,
  but understanding it should make watching the build messages more fun,
  and will help with problem resolution should the product not build
  cleanly for any reason.  The major components include "back" (dbms
  engine), "cl" (OS compatibility layer), "gl" (other less OS sensitive
  low level functions), "front" (user front ends), "common" (shared by
  back and front), and "dbutil" (dbms utilities).  Facilities in back
  include "opf" (optimizer), "qef" (query execution), and "dmf" (data
  management); facilities in the cl include "me" (memory management),
  "cs and csmt" (context switching internal and POSIX), and "handy"
  (various handy things); facilities in front include "qbf" (query by
  forms), "rep" (replication), and "embed" (language precompilers);
  facilities in facilities in common include "adf" (data abstraction),
  "gcf" (network communication), and "jdbc" (java support).


  Building Ingres
  ---------------

  Sign on as the ingres user and untar the Ingres source code build tree.
  The ingres_source directory at the root of this build tree is the ING_ROOT
  location mentioned above.

  In addition to the Ingres source code itself, you will need the Xerces
  2.7 headers and library (which provide the XML link between Ingres
  and the Apache web server), and you will need the Kerberos network
  authentication protocol headers.  Both of these components can be
  downloaded, for your convenience, from the same site from which you
  downloaded the Ingres source code itself.  Alternatively, you may
  already have these components installed on your system, or can find
  them at the following web sites:

	Xerces:		http://xml.apache.org/
	Kerberos:	http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/
  
  The version of Xerces that you can download from the Ingres Corporation
  web site includes only the source code.  Note that if you download
  Xerces as source from there or from apache.org, you must build the
  Xerces C library before you proceed with the Ingres build.  The Xerces
  build process is straightforward and is well documented; please see
  the instructions in the xerces-c-src_2_7_0 directory.  Alternatively,
  you may be able to download a binary version of Xerces for your system
  from the apache.org site. Note: This version of Xerces will NOT compile
  under Red Hat Enterprise Server (RHEL) 4.0. If you wish to build the Ingres 
  source code on this version of Linux, the Xerces library should be built
  in a compatable environment and move to the RHEL 4.0 system.

  For the Linux platform only, a special version of pax (the Portable Archive
  Interchange program) is required for the build. Modifications have been
  made to this program to allow it to work with the Ingres checkpoint process. 
  (Support has been added for the OCFS file system and for Linux files up to 
  8GB in length.  While the standard version of pax is adequate for creating 
  the Ingres tar installation medium, it is not suitable for Ingres runtime 
  operations.) This special version of pax is included with the Ingres source 
  and should be present under $ING_ROOT/pax and can be built using Jam.

  To build:

	cd $ING_ROOT/pax
	jam	

  When all of the necessary components have been downloaded (Ingres source
  tree, Xerces and Kerberos components, pax source tree), you are ready
  to begin the actual Ingres build process.  First cd to the ING_ROOT
  directory.  Then source a script to set up the build environment.
  You can set some required environment variables before invoking
  the script or can allow it to prompt you for any needed values.
  For example:

	export ING_ROOT=`pwd`
	source src/tools/port/jam/bldenv

  If you have downloaded the Xerces and Kerberos components to the
  ING_ROOT tree, the script will automatically set up the environment
  variables that point to these.  However, if either or both are located
  elsewhere on your system, you will be prompted for the paths, or
  you can set the required environment variables before sourcing the
  bldenv script.  For example:

	export ING_ROOT=`pwd`
	export XERCESCROOT=/my/own/xerces-c-src_2_5_0
	export XERCESLOC=$XERCESCROOT/lib
	export KRB5HDR=/my/own/Kerberos5/hdr
	source src/tools/port/jam/bldenv

  The bldenv script establishes other variables necessary for
  the compiling of Ingres, based on the user-supplied values.
  Some environment variables of note are:

  ING_SRCRULES	Jam build rules for Ingres
  ING_BUILD	location of built components (programs, libraries, etc.)
  ING_TST	path to the Ingres test tool source and test scripts
  ING_TOOLS	path to the Ingres test tool executables
  II_SYSTEM	run-time Ingres root location for the build process
  II_MANIFEST_DIR  location of Ingres component inventories
  TERM_INGRES	terminal setting for Ingres front end tools such as ABF

  Note that the PATH and CDPATH settings are also modified for the build
  process.

  Next, bootstrap the build.  This includes building mkjam and mkjams,
  which automate the creation of Jamfiles, and then invoking mkjams to
  set up the build tree:

	cd $ING_SRC/tools/port/jam
	jam
	mkjams
	cd $ING_SRC

  You are now ready to compile Ingres.  This is done with the following
  command:

	jam

  Because of the voluminous output of the build process and because you
  may want to examine the full output, it is wise to redirect the jam
  output to a file.  For example:

	jam >& jam.out &
	tail -f jam.out


  Auditing the build
  ------------------

  Some warning messages are expected during the build process (for
  explanations of some of these, see the Ingres building FAQ at
  http://www.ingres.com/).

  How can you tell, then, if the build was successful?  First, look at
  the final messages issued by jam.  Jam should report a (large) number
  of targets "updated", and should NOT report any targets as "failed"
  or "skipped".

  You should also run two programs to check the status of the build
  process for Ingres itself and for its testing tools.  To be sure that
  the building of all Ingres components is successful, use the buildrel
  program's audit option:

	buildrel -a

  Note that the buildrel audit step is required, since buildrel (in
  addition to checking for missing files) adjusts the file permissions of
  some of the built files.  If the Ingres build is successful, buildrel
  will not report any missing files.
  
  As a final auditing step, make sure that all the files needed for
  Ingres acceptance testing were correctly built:

  	tartools -a

  If this command too reports no missing files, your build is complete!


  Packaging Ingres
  ----------------

  Ingres can be packaged for installation either as a standard tar ball
  or as a set of RPM packages.  Use RPM only if your Linux distribution
  supports this package format.

  Whether you will be using the tar format or the RPM format, you must
  first assemble the Ingres components for packaging using the buildrel
  program.

  First, set up a staging area for this assembly process.  Typically,
  you would want to name this staging directory based on the "build="
  line in $ING_SRC/tools/port/conf/VERS.  For example, if the VERS file
  contains the line build=00 you would use the following commands:

	mkdir -p $ING_ROOT/release/r00
	cd $ING_ROOT/release/r00
	export II_RELEASE_DIR=`pwd`
	buildrel

  To create an installable Ingres tar ball, simply create a tar file
  that contains the components of this staging area:

	tar cvf ../ingres.tar *

  There is nothing magic about the name "ingres.tar".  For clarity
  (keeping track of product builds and the resulting tar files) you
  could call this, for example, "r00.tar" or "ingres_r00.tar".

  To package Ingres for delivery in RPM format, make sure that the
  Ingres components have been assembled as described above and that
  II_RELEASE_DIR is correctly set.  Then issue the following commands:

	buildrel -r
	iirpmbuild

  The RPM files are created in location $II_RPM_BUILDROOT/i386.


  Installing Ingres
  -----------------

  To install Ingres from the tar ball, please see the document "Getting
  Started" in file $ING_SRC/tools/techpub/pdf/gs.pdf

  For more information regarding the RPM format and Ingres, and for
  directions on installing the RPMs, please see the document "Getting
  Started for Linux" in file $ING_SRC/tools/techpub/pdf/gs-linux.pdf.
  Note: this latter document contains useful information regarding Ingres
  on Linux quite apart from the RPM documentation.

  If you install Ingres from RPMs, an environment setup script will be
  created in the ingres home directory.  However, if you install from
  the tar ball, you will need to create such a script yourself.  A
  minimal script for running Ingres looks like this:

  # Ingres bash shell environment setup script
  export II_SYSTEM=/home/ingres/ingres2006/tstinst
  export PATH=$II_SYSTEM/ingres/bin:$II_SYSTEM/ingres/utility:$PATH
  if [ "$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" ] ; then
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib:$II_SYSTEM/ingres/lib
  else
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib:$II_SYSTEM/ingres/lib
  fi
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  export TERM=vt100
  export TERM_INGRES=vt100fx

  Important: do not use the same ingres user signon for both building
  and running Ingres, as problems will result because of conflicting
  environment variables.  For installing and running Ingres, sign on as
  the ingres user and then source the setup script; do NOT run bldenv.


  Testing Ingres
  --------------

  The open source Ingres tree contains a limited set of acceptance tests
  to verify the integrity of your Ingres build.  For this automated
  testing the Ingres installation should be located in $ING_ROOT/tstinst.
  Use the above Ingres runtime environment setup script as an example
  for preparing for testing.  The example assumes that ING_ROOT is
  /home/ingres/ingres2006; modify this as needed based on the location of
  your Ingres build area.

  For further information about the acceptance tests please see the file
  named TESTING.
