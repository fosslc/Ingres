  Name: utcom.def -     UT Linking Rules Definition File.

        This file is used to create variant "utlnk.def" files for
        different target systems.  It specifies transformation rules
        used to link.

        BEWARE:  BEGIN EACH LINE WITH TAB ONLY - Not spaces
                 ENSURE that there are no blank characters at the end of the
                 lines.

        Create the file via:

                ccpp utcom.ccpp > utcom.def

  History:
        17-May-2005 (lakvi01)
	    Created. The need for this file arose because, Ingres on i64_win 
	    and a64_win is built (currently) using PSDK. bufferoverflowu.lib must
	    be linked with explicitly if PSDK is used. This will not be needed
	    when Whidbey will be used for building and on that day this file will 
	    be replaced with utlnk.def	    
	20-Sep-2010 (drivi01)
	    Remove bufferoverflowu.lib from 64-bit Windows link line.
	    Remove #ifdef for 64-bit Windows, it is not needed.
